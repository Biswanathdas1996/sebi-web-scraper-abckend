SEBI vide circular  CIR/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2017/73  dated June 30, 2017(hereinafter mentioned as 'Circular') and para 14 of Master Circular for stock brokers dated June 17, 2025 (hereinafter mentioned as 'Master Circular'), specified provisions pertaining to policy for annual inspection of members.\n2.  Presently, annual inspection of stock brokers/ depository participants ('Brokers'/DPs) are conducted by each of the MIIs (Stock Exchanges/Depositories/Clearing  Corporations)  separately.  Such  an  exercise unwarrantedly taxes the intermediaries due to frequent visits for  inspections by different  MIIs  which  result  in  disproportionate  diversion  of  resources  leading  to disruption in the routine operations of the entities.\n3.  Accordingly, in order to ensure ease of doing business and to take comprehensive view  of  entity's  operations  across  all  MIIs  along  with  optimum  utilization  of resources, the following has been decided\n- I. Joint annual inspection instead of separate inspections by MIIs\n\n:\n\nEntities selected for annual inspections shall be inspected for all segments jointly by all exchanges along with their depository participant (DP) operations (if  broker  is  also  registered  as  DP)  and  clearing  activity  (if  the  broker  is\n\nundertaking clearing for other brokers). DP operations and clearing activity undertaken  by  entities  shall  be  inspected  by  Depositories  and  Clearing Corporations, respectively.\n\nThis will ensure that entities selected by MIIs for their annual inspection shall be inspected jointly by all MIIs at one time.\n\n## II. Information sharing mechanism :\n\nIn order to improve the effectiveness of supervision, MIIs shall establish an information  sharing  mechanism  with  one  another  for  sharing  of  inspection observations of entities who hold multiple registrations with MIIs.\n\n## III. Rationalization and streamlining of criteria for selection of entities :\n\n- i.  It has been decided to revise the criteria for annual inspection as follows:\n- a.  Top 25 entities paying high and recurring penalties for non-reporting or short  reporting  of  margin/Client  Code  modification/CTCL  mismatch fines or   any   other   similar   high   risk   compliance   issue - shall   be inspected irrespective of when they were last inspected.\n- b.  Top 25 entities in terms of investor complaints and arbitration cases filed by investors, as percentage of number of active clients shall be inspected irrespective of the fact of when they were last inspected.\n- c. Top  25  entities based  on  'High risk score'  under  Risk  Based Supervision.\n- ii.  Entities that do not fall under any of the above categories shall be inspected by the MIIs at least once in three years.\n- iii.  However, entities inspected in preceding two years by any of the MII's/SEBI and/or entities that have not executed a single trade during last two financial years may not be considered for inspection under the above criteria.\n- iv.  Irrespective  of  the  above,  inspections of  Professional Clearing Members shall be conducted jointly by Clearing Corporations once in two years.\n\n4.  Notwithstanding the above, MIIs shall have the prerogative to carry out special purpose/limited  inspections  based  on  any  triggers  like  patterns  found  during investor complaint resolution/Arbitration, complaints on specific malpractices of a broker or references from various authorities. The inspection shall be irrespective of the fact of when the last inspection was carried out.\n5.  MIIs  are  advised  to  frame  a  joint  Standard  Operating  Procedure  (SOP)  by November 01, 2025 for detailed specifications of inspection criteria, information sharing  mechanism and designating one  MII as a 'Lead MII', which will initiate enforcement action for such inspections.\n6.  MIIs are advised to continuously review the policy of annual inspection and revise, as and when required, in consultation with SEBI.\n7.  Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) shall continue to be governed by SEBI circular on 'Enhanced obligations and responsibilities on QSBs' dated February 06, 2023 and any changes issued from time to time by SEBI/exchanges.\n8.  With the issuance of this circular, SEBI Circular CIR/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2017/73 dated June 30, 2017 stands rescinded and  para  14  of  Master  Circular  for  Stock  Brokers  dated  June  17,  2025  stands amended as per this circular.\n9.

Executive Summary\n\nRecently, writ petitions were filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India to formulate appropriate rules and guidelines for conducting Digital Know Your Client ('KYC') /e-KYC/video KYC (Know Your Customer) process through alternative methods with a view to ensuring that the process is more inclusive and accessible to all persons with disabilities in accordance with the provisions of the Rights of Persons  with  Disabilities  Act,  2016  ('RPwD  Act,  2016')  and  rules  made thereunder.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court, in its judgment dated April 30, 2025, in the matter of Pragya Prasun &amp; Ors. Vs. Union of India and Ors. [WP(C)/289/2024] and Amar Jain vs. Union of India &amp; Ors. [WP(C)/49/2025] pertaining to Digital Accessibility for persons with disabilities, has inter alia held that the right to Digital Access is an intrinsic component of right to life and personal liberty.\n\nIn line with the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated April 30, 2025, SEBI has directed its efforts towards strengthening the accessibility of Digital Platforms in the securities market.\n\nIn order to promote an inclusive digital ecosystem in the Indian Securities Market, this Annexure outlines a set of actionable directions to ensure digital accessibility. These directions are divided into thematic sections for better comprehension and execution by SEBI Regulated Entities (REs).\n\nHereafter, the term 'Digital Accessibility' shall inherently be understood as 'Digital Accessibility for Persons with Disabilities' in order to prioritize digital accessibility for all persons with disabilities - including but not limited to acid attack survivors suffering from permanent facial/eye disfigurement, persons with blindness and low vision, and other similarly placed individuals.\n\n## B. Scope\n\nAll  REs shall ensure that their Digital Platforms and content published on the digital platform shall strictly adhere to the accessibility standards and guidelines, including:\n\n1.  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ('WCAG') 2.1 or latest version.\n2.  Accessibility guidelines as described in the latest version of  Guidelines for Indian Government Websites ('GIGW').\n\n)                                                                          Page\n\n3.  IS 17802: Indian Standards on Accessibility Requirements for Information and Communication Technology ('ICT') Products and Services.\n4.  Provisions of the Rights of  Persons  with Disabilities Act,  2016  and corresponding rules for digital accessibility mentioned in this Circular.\n\nThese standards shall serve as the baseline for compliance under this circular and must be referred to in all digital initiatives.\n\n## C. Directions for ensuring Digital Accessibility\n\n## Section 1: Institutional Arrangement\n\n- 1.1. The  compliance  with  this  circular  shall  be  reviewed  and  approved  by Managing Director or the Managing Partner or the Proprietor of the REs, as may be applicable. REs shall designate any senior officer as the Nodal Officer for digital accessibility compliance. In the absence of an officially designated Nodal Officer, the Compliance Officer or the Proprietor shall be deemed  to be the Nodal Officer for ensuring digital accessibility compliance.\n- 1.2. The major roles and responsibilities of the Nodal Officer shall be to ensure digital accessibility for every investor by ensuring that activities, including but not limited to conducting accessibility audits, mitigation of accessibility audit  findings,  implementation  of  accessibility  guidelines,  and  timely redressal of grievance. The Nodal Officer shall serve as the contact point for SEBI in any matter pertaining to digital accessibility.\n- 1.3. A grievance redressal mechanism specific to accessibility issues shall be institutionalized within the REs. Channels such as email, helpline, and web forms must be user-friendly for PwDs. The system must include provisions for escalation to senior officers.\n- 1.4. The reporting of compliance with respect to this circular shall be done by the REs to their respective authority(ies) as per the reporting mentioned in this Circular.\n\n## Section 2: Web and Document Accessibility\n\n- 2.1. The Digital Platforms of the REs shall include features such as Indian Sign Language (ISL) videos, closed captioning, descriptive audio, and alternate text  for  images.  For  instance,  an  explainer  video  on  KYC  must  include captions and ISL interpretation.\n\n)                                                                          Page\n\n- 2.2. All  circulars,  notices,  and  investor  documents  published  on  the  Digital Platforms of the RE's (website, mobile application, etc.) in PDF or other formats  must  follow  accessible  document  standards-such  as  tagged PDFs, logical reading order, proper use of headings, and alt text. The RE shall follow the PDF techniques ( https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20TECHS/pdf) covered in WCAG 2.1 for the same. If a revised standard for accessibility  of  Text  documents  is  published  by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium, the owner of WCAG standards) the compliance to the venue standard should be ensured.\n\n## Section 3: Training and Awareness\n\n- 3.1. Training modules that give detailed understanding on digital accessibility (website,  mobile  application,  etc.)  shall  be  part  of  all  internal  training programs for staff and third-party service providers who are developing and publishing  content  for  dissemination  via  Digital  Platforms.  The  Digital Platform shall be 'accessible by design' . Trainings should emphasize on design  wise  digital  accessibility.  The  trainings  should  cover  behavioural training,  assistive  tools,  and  inclusive  experience  for  normal  as  well  as differently abled users.\n\n## Section 4: Registration and e-KYC\n\n- 4.1. All REs shall ensure that digital KYC, e-KYC, and video KYC processes include  alternatives  to  accommodate  differently  abled  users/clients.  For example, human-assisted video KYC, allowing scanned document uploads, or voice-assisted KYC for visually impaired users.\n- 4.2. KYC and client registration forms shall include a mandatory field to indicate disability status and options to select specific provisions such as helpdesk call back for assistance. Any application of a client with disability shall be rejected by the REs only after a review by a designated human officer and the said officer shall be empowered to override automated rejections and approve applications on a case by case basis, thereby ensuring equitable access to services of the REs for persons with disabilities.\n\n## Section 5: Digital Accessibility Audits and Remediation\n\n- 5.1. All  REs  shall  initiate  a  comprehensive  accessibility  audit  of  their  digital platforms  including  websites,  mobile  apps,  portals  through  International Association of Accessibility Professionals ('IAAP'). The audit shall follow\n\n)                                                                          Page\n\n- the  latest  WCAG,  GIGW  guidelines  and  RPwD  Act  and  sules  made thereunder and also SEBI from time to time. The said accessibility audit shall include usability testing by persons with disabilities.\n- 5.2. Based on the audit findings, REs shall prepare and implement a plan for remediation of audit observations.\n- 5.3. Existing digital platforms must be upgraded to meet accessibility standards within the transition timeline.\n- 5.4. All REs shall conduct annual accessibility audits of their digital platforms including websites, mobile apps, portals through IAAP certified accessibility professionals  and  reports  shall  be  submitted  as  per  the  mechanism specified in direction 1.4 in Section 1 of this Annexure.\n\n## Section 6: Procurement and Technical Compliance\n\n- 6.1. All  newly  developed/procured  digital  solutions  shall  conform  to  latest WCAG, IS17802, GIGW guidelines and the provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016  and  rules  made  thereunder.  In  case  of  Software  as  a  Service ('SaaS')/  customised  SaaS  products,  vendors  must  seek  conformance with the accessibility guidelines by conducting audit of their product/service in  accordance  to  WCAG  2.1  (or  latest)  accessibility  guidelines.  The responsibility to ensure the accessibility of a Digital Platform shall lie with the REs.\n- 6.2. Accessibility  requirements  shall  be  part  of  all  Request  for  Proposals ('RFPs') and procurement contracts of the REs and evaluation criteria of the REs shall assign due weightage to accessibility readiness.\n\n-------x x x-------\n\n)                                                                          Page",

Executive Summary\n\nRecently, writ petitions were filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India to formulate appropriate rules and guidelines for conducting Digital Know Your Client ('KYC') /e-KYC/video KYC (Know Your Customer) process through alternative methods with a view to ensuring that the process is more inclusive and accessible to all persons with disabilities in accordance with the provisions of the Rights of Persons  with  Disabilities  Act,  2016  ('RPwD  Act,  2016')  and  rules  made thereunder.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court, in its judgment dated April 30, 2025, in the matter of Pragya Prasun &amp; Ors. Vs. Union of India and Ors. [WP(C)/289/2024] and Amar Jain vs. Union of India &amp; Ors. [WP(C)/49/2025] pertaining to Digital Accessibility for persons with disabilities, has inter alia held that the right to Digital Access is an intrinsic component of right to life and personal liberty.\n\nIn line with the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated April 30, 2025, SEBI has directed its efforts towards strengthening the accessibility of Digital Platforms in the securities market.\n\nIn order to promote an inclusive digital ecosystem in the Indian Securities Market, this Annexure outlines a set of actionable directions to ensure digital accessibility. These directions are divided into thematic sections for better comprehension and execution by SEBI Regulated Entities (REs).\n\nHereafter, the term 'Digital Accessibility' shall inherently be understood as 'Digital Accessibility for Persons with Disabilities' in order to prioritize digital accessibility for all persons with disabilities - including but not limited to acid attack survivors suffering from permanent facial/eye disfigurement, persons with blindness and low vision, and other similarly placed individuals.\n\n## B. Scope\n\nAll  REs shall ensure that their Digital Platforms and content published on the digital platform shall strictly adhere to the accessibility standards and guidelines, including:\n\n1.  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ('WCAG') 2.1 or latest version.\n2.  Accessibility guidelines as described in the latest version of  Guidelines for Indian Government Websites ('GIGW').\n\n)                                                                          Page\n\n3.  IS 17802: Indian Standards on Accessibility Requirements for Information and Communication Technology ('ICT') Products and Services.\n4.  Provisions of the Rights of  Persons  with Disabilities Act,  2016  and corresponding rules for digital accessibility mentioned in this Circular.\n\nThese standards shall serve as the baseline for compliance under this circular and must be referred to in all digital initiatives.\n\n## C. Directions for ensuring Digital Accessibility\n\n## Section 1: Institutional Arrangement\n\n- 1.1. The  compliance  with  this  circular  shall  be  reviewed  and  approved  by Managing Director or the Managing Partner or the Proprietor of the REs, as may be applicable. REs shall designate any senior officer as the Nodal Officer for digital accessibility compliance. In the absence of an officially designated Nodal Officer, the Compliance Officer or the Proprietor shall be deemed  to be the Nodal Officer for ensuring digital accessibility compliance.\n- 1.2. The major roles and responsibilities of the Nodal Officer shall be to ensure digital accessibility for every investor by ensuring that activities, including but not limited to conducting accessibility audits, mitigation of accessibility audit  findings,  implementation  of  accessibility  guidelines,  and  timely redressal of grievance. The Nodal Officer shall serve as the contact point for SEBI in any matter pertaining to digital accessibility.\n- 1.3. A grievance redressal mechanism specific to accessibility issues shall be institutionalized within the REs. Channels such as email, helpline, and web forms must be user-friendly for PwDs. The system must include provisions for escalation to senior officers.\n- 1.4. The reporting of compliance with respect to this circular shall be done by the REs to their respective authority(ies) as per the reporting mentioned in this Circular.\n\n## Section 2: Web and Document Accessibility\n\n- 2.1. The Digital Platforms of the REs shall include features such as Indian Sign Language (ISL) videos, closed captioning, descriptive audio, and alternate text  for  images.  For  instance,  an  explainer  video  on  KYC  must  include captions and ISL interpretation.\n\n)                                                                          Page\n\n- 2.2. All  circulars,  notices,  and  investor  documents  published  on  the  Digital Platforms of the RE's (website, mobile application, etc.) in PDF or other formats  must  follow  accessible  document  standards-such  as  tagged PDFs, logical reading order, proper use of headings, and alt text. The RE shall follow the PDF techniques ( https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20TECHS/pdf) covered in WCAG 2.1 for the same. If a revised standard for accessibility  of  Text  documents  is  published  by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium, the owner of WCAG standards) the compliance to the venue standard should be ensured.\n\n## Section 3: Training and Awareness\n\n- 3.1. Training modules that give detailed understanding on digital accessibility (website,  mobile  application,  etc.)  shall  be  part  of  all  internal  training programs for staff and third-party service providers who are developing and publishing  content  for  dissemination  via  Digital  Platforms.  The  Digital Platform shall be 'accessible by design' . Trainings should emphasize on design  wise  digital  accessibility.  The  trainings  should  cover  behavioural training,  assistive  tools,  and  inclusive  experience  for  normal  as  well  as differently abled users.\n\n## Section 4: Registration and e-KYC\n\n- 4.1. All REs shall ensure that digital KYC, e-KYC, and video KYC processes include  alternatives  to  accommodate  differently  abled  users/clients.  For example, human-assisted video KYC, allowing scanned document uploads, or voice-assisted KYC for visually impaired users.\n- 4.2. KYC and client registration forms shall include a mandatory field to indicate disability status and options to select specific provisions such as helpdesk call back for assistance. Any application of a client with disability shall be rejected by the REs only after a review by a designated human officer and the said officer shall be empowered to override automated rejections and approve applications on a case by case basis, thereby ensuring equitable access to services of the REs for persons with disabilities.\n\n## Section 5: Digital Accessibility Audits and Remediation\n\n- 5.1. All  REs  shall  initiate  a  comprehensive  accessibility  audit  of  their  digital platforms  including  websites,  mobile  apps,  portals  through  International Association of Accessibility Professionals ('IAAP'). The audit shall follow\n\n)                                                                          Page\n\n- the  latest  WCAG,  GIGW  guidelines  and  RPwD  Act  and  sules  made thereunder and also SEBI from time to time.

All REs shall conduct annual accessibility audits of their digital platforms including websites, mobile apps, portals through IAAP certified accessibility professionals  and  reports  shall  be  submitted  as  per  the  mechanism specified in direction 1.4 in Section 1 of this Annexure.\n\n## Section 6: Procurement and Technical Compliance\n\n- 6.1. All  newly  developed/procured  digital  solutions  shall  conform  to  latest WCAG, IS17802, GIGW guidelines and the provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016  and  rules  made  thereunder.  In  case  of  Software  as  a  Service ('SaaS')/  customised  SaaS  products,  vendors  must  seek  conformance with the accessibility guidelines by conducting audit of their product/service in  accordance  to  WCAG  2.1  (or  latest)  accessibility  guidelines.  The responsibility to ensure the accessibility of a Digital Platform shall lie with the REs.\n- 6.2. Accessibility  requirements  shall  be  part  of  all  Request  for  Proposals ('RFPs') and procurement contracts of the REs and evaluation criteria of the REs shall assign due weightage to accessibility readiness.\n\n-------x x x-------\n\n)                                                                          Page",

Whether brokerage services or merchant banking services provided by research entity are considered as distribution activity?\n\nNo. Brokerage services or merchant banking services provided by research entity are not considered as distribution activity for the purpose of regulation 26C of RA Regulations.\n\n31.  Whether  RAs/research  entity  can  provide  distribution  services  on  the products/securities on which they are not providing research services/brokerage/merchant banking services to their clients?\n\nIs  client  level  segregation  (i.e.  at  group  level,  same  client  cannot  be provided  both  research  as  well  as  distribution  service)  required  if distribution and research services are provided on different categories of securities?\n\nAn RA is expected to provide independent, unbiased, and objective research on  securities.  It  is  important  to  ensure  that  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest between the research activity and other activities of the RA. Purpose of the regulation  26C  of  RA  Regulations  is  to  address  the  inherent  concerns  on potential  conflict  of  interest  of  RA  when  it  provides  both  the  research  and distribution services to their client that may not be in the interest of client. Thus in terms of the regulatory intent, RA/research entity cannot provide research services for the securities/products in case it also provides distribution services for such securities/products.\n\nThus, in alignment with the intent of the regulation, in exercise of power under regulation  33  of  RA  Regulations,  it  is  clarified  that  RA/research  entity  can provide  distribution  services  on  products/securities  provided  they  are  not providing research services on such products/securities being distributed and are providing such distribution services through separately identifiable\n\ndepartment  or  division  or  business  unit  within  the  same  entity  or  through  a separate entity on an arms' length basis.\n\nSome clarifications with illustrations are given below:\n\n- i. Client level segregation of research and distribution services is not required if RA/research entity distributes mutual funds/PMS schemes/AIF products but provides research services only on individual stocks and is not providing research services on mutual funds/PMS schemes/AIF products. e.g. If a RA distributes  'Mutual  Fund  Scheme  A'  at  family  or  group  level,  it  cannot provide research services on 'Mutual Fund Scheme A' and vice versa at family/group level.\n- ii. The RA/research entity is required to maintain client level segregation at family/group level in case it is engaged in providing research services on mutual funds and is also engaged in distribution of mutual funds.\n- iii. RA/research entity  may carry  out distribution  of  other products  (such  as banking products) not under purview of SEBI to their clients at family/group level.  Any  grievances  related  to  such  products  shall  not  come  under purview of SEBI.\n\nNote:  For  the  purpose  of  abundant  clarity,  it  may  be  noted  that  these provisions/clarifications do not restrict distributor of mutual funds from providing any  investment  advice  to  its  clients  incidental  to  its  primary  activity  as mentioned  under  regulation  4(d)  of  SEBI  (Investment  Adviser)  Regulations, 2013.\n\n## 32.  Is NISM certification mandatory for the sales staff, support staff, customer support team or other client-facing staff not involved in research?\n\nAs per the explanation to regulation 2(ne) of the RA regulations, all client and public  facing  persons  such  as  analysts,  sales  staff,  service  relationship managers, client relationship managers, etc., by whatever name called, shall be  deemed  to  be  persons  associated  with  research  services,  but  shall  not\n\ninclude  persons  who  discharge  clerical  or  office  administrative  functions  if where there is no connection with research services and they have no client contact.\n\nIi  is  clarified  that  the  aforesaid  personnel  are  not  considered  as  persons associated with research services if -\n\n- (i)  these personnel while performing activities/services do not have client contact, or\n- (ii)  these activities/services have no connection with the research services provided as a RA.\n\nIt shall not be mandatory for such persons to obtain the NISM certification.\n\nPersons associated with research services shall obtain the relevant certification from NISM as specified by SEBI within one year from the date of this circular or within the timeline as may be specified by SEBI.\n\n33.  Whether  the  following  compliance  requirements  are  also  applicable  in case of non-fee paying clients including institutional investors? -\n- i. Disclosure  of  terms  and  conditions  of  research  services  including Most  Important  Terms  and  Conditions  (MITC)  and  signing/taking consent of client on these terms and conditions\n- ii. KYC Requirements\n- iii. Maintenance  of  records  of  interactions  with  clients  such  as  call recordings, emails, sms\n- i.  MITC  is  primarily  intended  for  investors  who  may  not  have  necessary resources  to  gather  necessary  information  to  take  informed  decision. Institutional investors/Qualified institutional Buyers (QIBs) are sophisticated investors who have necessary skills, knowledge and means to protect their interests and take informed decisions.  Hence, in exercise of power under Regulation 33 and for ease of doing business, it is clarified that consent on the  terms  and  conditions  including  most  important  terms  and  conditions\n\n(MITC) of research services shall not be mandatory for the clients who are institutional investors or QIBs. However, RAs/research entities are required to disclose the terms and conditions of research services including MITC to these clients.\n\n- ii.   RAs/research entities are required to follow the KYC procedure for clients paying fees directly for research services.\n- iii.  The requirement of maintenance of records of interactions with clients such as call recordings, emails, etc. is applicable for fee-paying as well as non-fee paying  clients  whereas  non-fee  paying  clients  are  the  clients  receiving research services as a value added service along with other services availed from the research entity or any other entity at family/group level on payable basis. For the purpose of abundant clarity, it is to be stated that call recording is not required if the interaction with client is made through means such as email, etc. for which digital footprint is available.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  records  of  the  client  interaction  is  to  document  the interaction to cater to potential client grievances related to research services provided  by  the  research  analyst/  research  entity.  Access  to  an  effective grievance redressal mechanism is a basic right of every investor irrespective of  the  nature  of  the  investors  i.e.  individual/  HUF/  institutions  etc.  Hence, RAs/research  entities shall ensure  compliance  with  the  provision  for maintenance of records of interactions even in case of their clients who are institutional investors or QIBs.\n\n34.  Whether  non-fee  paying  clients  are  considered  'clients'  of  research entity?\n\nWhether number of such non-fee paying clients shall be considered as clients for the purpose of periodic reporting and determining the deposit amount to be lien marked to RAASB?\n\n## Whether research entity is required to disclose and take consent on the terms and conditions for research services from these clients?\n\nThe  term  'consideration'  under  RA  regulation  is  defined  as  any  form  of economic benefit including non-cash benefit, received or receivable, directly or indirectly, in any form whether from client or otherwise for providing research services.\n\nNon-fee paying clients are the clients receiving research services as a value added service along with other services availed from the research entity or any other entity at family/group level on payable basis. This is also highlighted in response to FAQ No. 29 above where 'consideration' is received indirectly by research entity.\n\nThus, the number of clients of RA/research entity shall mean total of fee-paying clients and non-fee paying clients of RA/research entity.\n\nRA/research entity is required to report this number of clients (fee-paying and non-fee paying clients) in periodic reporting format and shall also form basis for determining the requisite deposit amount applicable to the RA/research entity.\n\nThe research entity is required to ensure the compliance with the requirement of disclosure of terms and conditions of research services to all such clients and  to  take  their  consent  thereupon,  except  for  clients  who  are  institutional investors/QIBs for whom mere disclosure shall suffice and there shall be no requirement of seeking their consent to terms and conditions.\n\n35.  Whether  the  exemption  to  compliance  with  client  level  segregation  of research  services  and  distribution  activities  is  allowed  to  all  entities offering services to Institutional clients and not only to entities providing research services exclusively to institutional clients?\n\nAs  per  the  existing  provisions,  exemption  on  compliance  with  client  level segregation  of  research  services  and  distribution  activities  is  given  to  only entities providing research services exclusively to institutional clients if the client signs a standard waiver.\n\nInstitutional clients/QIBs are sophisticated investors who have necessary skills, knowledge and means to protect their interests and take informed decisions. Accordingly, in exercise of power under Regulation 33 of RA Regulations and for  ease  of doing business, it  is clarified  that  even in  cases  where research service  is  not  exclusively  provided  to  institutional  clients/QIBs,  all  research analysts/entities are exempted from 'client level segregation of research and distribution activities' for their institutional clients/QIBs if such a client provides a standard waiver. Client may also provide such standard waiver through email or any other electronically verifiable mode.  However, such exemption shall not be applicable in case of clients other than institutional clients/QIBs.\n\n## 36.  For  technical  recommendations, whether a mere technical chart with a time stamp shall suffice as a research rationale?\n\nResearch analyst or research entity are required to maintain the rationale for arriving  at  research  recommendations.  They are  required  to  have  adequate documentary basis, supported by research, for preparing a research report and shall ensure that recommendations in the research report are corroborated by relevant data and analysis forming the basis for such research service.\n\n************************************************************************",

Whether brokerage services or merchant banking services provided by research entity are considered as distribution activity?\n\nNo. Brokerage services or merchant banking services provided by research entity are not considered as distribution activity for the purpose of regulation 26C of RA Regulations.\n\n31.  Whether  RAs/research  entity  can  provide  distribution  services  on  the products/securities on which they are not providing research services/brokerage/merchant banking services to their clients?\n\nIs  client  level  segregation  (i.e.  at  group  level,  same  client  cannot  be provided  both  research  as  well  as  distribution  service)  required  if distribution and research services are provided on different categories of securities?\n\nAn RA is expected to provide independent, unbiased, and objective research on  securities.  It  is  important  to  ensure  that  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest between the research activity and other activities of the RA. Purpose of the regulation  26C  of  RA  Regulations  is  to  address  the  inherent  concerns  on potential  conflict  of  interest  of  RA  when  it  provides  both  the  research  and distribution services to their client that may not be in the interest of client. Thus in terms of the regulatory intent, RA/research entity cannot provide research services for the securities/products in case it also provides distribution services for such securities/products.\n\nThus, in alignment with the intent of the regulation, in exercise of power under regulation  33  of  RA  Regulations,  it  is  clarified  that  RA/research  entity  can provide  distribution  services  on  products/securities  provided  they  are  not providing research services on such products/securities being distributed and are providing such distribution services through separately identifiable\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndepartment  or  division  or  business  unit  within  the  same  entity  or  through  a separate entity on an arms' length basis.\n\nSome clarifications with illustrations are given below:\n\n- i. Client level segregation of research and distribution services is not required if RA/research entity distributes mutual funds/PMS schemes/AIF products but provides research services only on individual stocks and is not providing research services on mutual funds/PMS schemes/AIF products. e.g. If a RA distributes  'Mutual  Fund  Scheme  A'  at  family  or  group  level,  it  cannot provide research services on 'Mutual Fund Scheme A' and vice versa at family/group level.\n- ii. The RA/research entity is required to maintain client level segregation at family/group level in case it is engaged in providing research services on mutual funds and is also engaged in distribution of mutual funds.\n- iii. RA/research entity  may carry  out distribution  of  other products  (such  as banking products) not under purview of SEBI to their clients at family/group level.  Any  grievances  related  to  such  products  shall  not  come  under purview of SEBI.\n\nNote:  For  the  purpose  of  abundant  clarity,  it  may  be  noted  that  these provisions/clarifications do not restrict distributor of mutual funds from providing any  investment  advice  to  its  clients  incidental  to  its  primary  activity  as mentioned  under  regulation  4(d)  of  SEBI  (Investment  Adviser)  Regulations, 2013.\n\n## 32.  Is NISM certification mandatory for the sales staff, support staff, customer support team or other client-facing staff not involved in research?\n\nAs per the explanation to regulation 2(ne) of the RA regulations, all client and public  facing  persons  such  as  analysts,  sales  staff,  service  relationship managers, client relationship managers, etc., by whatever name called, shall be  deemed  to  be  persons  associated  with  research  services,  but  shall  not\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninclude  persons  who  discharge  clerical  or  office  administrative  functions  if where there is no connection with research services and they have no client contact.\n\nIi  is  clarified  that  the  aforesaid  personnel  are  not  considered  as  persons associated with research services if -\n\n- (i)  these personnel while performing activities/services do not have client contact, or\n- (ii)  these activities/services have no connection with the research services provided as a RA.\n\nIt shall not be mandatory for such persons to obtain the NISM certification.\n\nPersons associated with research services shall obtain the relevant certification from NISM as specified by SEBI within one year from the date of this circular or within the timeline as may be specified by SEBI.\n\n33.  Whether  the  following  compliance  requirements  are  also  applicable  in case of non-fee paying clients including institutional investors? -\n- i. Disclosure  of  terms  and  conditions  of  research  services  including Most  Important  Terms  and  Conditions  (MITC)  and  signing/taking consent of client on these terms and conditions\n- ii. KYC Requirements\n- iii. Maintenance  of  records  of  interactions  with  clients  such  as  call recordings, emails, sms\n- i.  MITC  is  primarily  intended  for  investors  who  may  not  have  necessary resources  to  gather  necessary  information  to  take  informed  decision. Institutional investors/Qualified institutional Buyers (QIBs) are sophisticated investors who have necessary skills, knowledge and means to protect their interests and take informed decisions.  Hence, in exercise of power under Regulation 33 and for ease of doing business, it is clarified that consent on the  terms  and  conditions  including  most  important  terms  and  conditions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(MITC) of research services shall not be mandatory for the clients who are institutional investors or QIBs. However, RAs/research entities are required to disclose the terms and conditions of research services including MITC to these clients.\n\n- ii.   RAs/research entities are required to follow the KYC procedure for clients paying fees directly for research services.\n- iii.  The requirement of maintenance of records of interactions with clients such as call recordings, emails, etc. is applicable for fee-paying as well as non-fee paying  clients  whereas  non-fee  paying  clients  are  the  clients  receiving research services as a value added service along with other services availed from the research entity or any other entity at family/group level on payable basis. For the purpose of abundant clarity, it is to be stated that call recording is not required if the interaction with client is made through means such as email, etc. for which digital footprint is available.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  records  of  the  client  interaction  is  to  document  the interaction to cater to potential client grievances related to research services provided  by  the  research  analyst/  research  entity.  Access  to  an  effective grievance redressal mechanism is a basic right of every investor irrespective of  the  nature  of  the  investors  i.e.  individual/  HUF/  institutions  etc.  Hence, RAs/research  entities shall ensure  compliance  with  the  provision  for maintenance of records of interactions even in case of their clients who are institutional investors or QIBs.\n\n34.  Whether  non-fee  paying  clients  are  considered  'clients'  of  research entity?\n\nWhether number of such non-fee paying clients shall be considered as clients for the purpose of periodic reporting and determining the deposit amount to be lien marked to RAASB?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Whether research entity is required to disclose and take consent on the terms and conditions for research services from these clients?\n\nThe  term  'consideration'  under  RA  regulation  is  defined  as  any  form  of economic benefit including non-cash benefit, received or receivable, directly or indirectly, in any form whether from client or otherwise for providing research services.\n\nNon-fee paying clients are the clients receiving research services as a value added service along with other services availed from the research entity or any other entity at family/group level on payable basis. This is also highlighted in response to FAQ No. 29 above where 'consideration' is received indirectly by research entity.\n\nThus, the number of clients of RA/research entity shall mean total of fee-paying clients and non-fee paying clients of RA/research entity.\n\nRA/research entity is required to report this number of clients (fee-paying and non-fee paying clients) in periodic reporting format and shall also form basis for determining the requisite deposit amount applicable to the RA/research entity.\n\nThe research entity is required to ensure the compliance with the requirement of disclosure of terms and conditions of research services to all such clients and  to  take  their  consent  thereupon,  except  for  clients  who  are  institutional investors/QIBs for whom mere disclosure shall suffice and there shall be no requirement of seeking their consent to terms and conditions.\n\n35.  Whether  the  exemption  to  compliance  with  client  level  segregation  of research  services  and  distribution  activities  is  allowed  to  all  entities offering services to Institutional clients and not only to entities providing research services exclusively to institutional clients?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs  per  the  existing  provisions,  exemption  on  compliance  with  client  level segregation  of  research  services  and  distribution  activities  is  given  to  only entities providing research services exclusively to institutional clients if the client signs a standard waiver.\n\nInstitutional clients/QIBs are sophisticated investors who have necessary skills, knowledge and means to protect their interests and take informed decisions. Accordingly, in exercise of power under Regulation 33 of RA Regulations and for  ease  of doing business, it  is clarified  that  even in  cases  where research service  is  not  exclusively  provided  to  institutional  clients/QIBs,  all  research analysts/entities are exempted from 'client level segregation of research and distribution activities' for their institutional clients/QIBs if such a client provides a standard waiver. Client may also provide such standard waiver through email or any other electronically verifiable mode.  However, such exemption shall not be applicable in case of clients other than institutional clients/QIBs.\n\n## 36.  For  technical  recommendations, whether a mere technical chart with a time stamp shall suffice as a research rationale?\n\nResearch analyst or research entity are required to maintain the rationale for arriving  at  research  recommendations.  They are  required  to  have  adequate documentary basis, supported by research, for preparing a research report and shall ensure that recommendations in the research report are corroborated by relevant data and analysis forming the basis for such research service.\n\n************************************************************************",

Transfer of securities in physical mode was discontinued with effect from April 01, 2019. Subsequently, it was clarified that transfer deeds lodged prior to deadline of April 01, 2019 and rejected/returned due to deficiency in the documents may be re-lodged with requisite documents. It was further decided to fix March 31, 2021 as the cut-off date for re-lodgement of transfer deeds.\n2.  SEBI received representation from investors as well as RTAs and listed companies that some of the investors had missed the timelines for re-lodging their documents for transfer of securities. This issue was discussed in a Panel of Experts which included RTAs, listed companies and Legal Expert. Based on discussion, the Panel recommended that to alleviate the issue faced by the investors that missed the March 31, 2021 deadline for re-lodgement, one more opportunity may be granted for them to re-lodge such shares for transfer.\n3.  Thus, in order to facilitate ease of investing for investors and to secure the rights of investors in the securities which were purchased by them, it has been decided to  open  a  special  window  only  for  re-lodgement  of  transfer  deeds,  which  were lodged prior to the deadline of April 01, 2019 and rejected/returned/not attended to\n\ndue to deficiency in the documents/process/or otherwise, for a period of six months from July 07, 2025 till January 06, 2026.\n\n4.  During this period, the securities that are re-lodged for transfer (including those requests that are pending with the listed company /  RTA, as on date) shall be issued only in demat mode. Due process shall be followed for such transfer-cumdemat requests.\n5.  Listed companies, RTAs and Stock Exchanges shall publicize the opening of this special window through various media including print and social media, on a bimonthly basis during the six-month period.\n6.  RTAs/listed companies shall have focussed teams to attend to such requests.\n7.

Transfer of securities in physical mode was discontinued with effect from April 01, 2019. Subsequently, it was clarified that transfer deeds lodged prior to deadline of April 01, 2019 and rejected/returned due to deficiency in the documents may be re-lodged with requisite documents. It was further decided to fix March 31, 2021 as the cut-off date for re-lodgement of transfer deeds.\n2.  SEBI received representation from investors as well as RTAs and listed companies that some of the investors had missed the timelines for re-lodging their documents for transfer of securities. This issue was discussed in a Panel of Experts which included RTAs, listed companies and Legal Expert. Based on discussion, the Panel recommended that to alleviate the issue faced by the investors that missed the March 31, 2021 deadline for re-lodgement, one more opportunity may be granted for them to re-lodge such shares for transfer.\n3.  Thus, in order to facilitate ease of investing for investors and to secure the rights of investors in the securities which were purchased by them, it has been decided to  open  a  special  window  only  for  re-lodgement  of  transfer  deeds,  which  were lodged prior to the deadline of April 01, 2019 and rejected/returned/not attended to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndue to deficiency in the documents/process/or otherwise, for a period of six months from July 07, 2025 till January 06, 2026.\n\n4.  During this period, the securities that are re-lodged for transfer (including those requests that are pending with the listed company /  RTA, as on date) shall be issued only in demat mode. Due process shall be followed for such transfer-cumdemat requests.\n5.  Listed companies, RTAs and Stock Exchanges shall publicize the opening of this special window through various media including print and social media, on a bimonthly basis during the six-month period.\n6.  RTAs/listed companies shall have focussed teams to attend to such requests.\n7.  RTAs/listed companies shall provide reports on:\n5. 7.1 publicity; and\n6. 7.2 shares re-lodged for transfer cum demat in the format specified by SEBI (provided at Annexure-A) on monthly basis.\n8.

SCORES facilitates tracking the status of the complaint and ODR is a platform to file complaints/dispute for resolution through online conciliation and arbitration.\n- iv.

SCORES facilitates tracking the status of the complaint and ODR is a platform to file complaints/dispute for resolution through online conciliation and arbitration.\n- iv.

Objective\n\n- 1.1.  Keeping in view the significant advancements in payment systems and with an objective to further enhance accessibility and safety in the securities market, it has been decided to put in place a structured Unified Payment Interface ('UPI') address mechanism for SEBI-registered investor-facing intermediaries (' intermediaries ') to collect funds from their investors. This mechanism shall provide investors with the option to transfer funds directly to the requisite bank accounts of intermediaries that have been validated with SEBI. The transfer of funds through this mechanism will assure investors that their payments are being made to the verified and registered market intermediaries.\n- 1.2.  This  initiative  is  being  operationalized  pursuant  to  public  consultation  and extensive  deliberations  with  relevant  stakeholders,  including  the  National Payments  Corporation  of  India  (NPCI)  and  the  SCSBs.  The  operational procedure  for  implementing  this  structured  UPI  address  framework by intermediaries is detailed in the subsequent sections of this circular. Additionally,  a  flowchart  outlining  the  end-to-end  process,  along  with  key decision points related to the allocation and implementation of structured UPI IDs, is provided at Annexure A .\n\n- 1.3.  While  the  use  of  this  structured  UPI  mechanism  by  investors  shall  remain optional, it is mandatory for intermediaries to obtain and make available this structured UPI address to their investors . Additionally, intermediaries are advised and encouraged to actively promote and facilitate the adoption of this mechanism among their investors.\n\n## 2. Structure of the Dedicated UPI Address\n\n- 2.1.  A  UPI  address  (UPI ID) is typically  made up of a  Username and a handle, separated  by  an  '@'  symbol.  In  this  mechanism,  Username  will  be  an alphanumeric ID that will be generated for the user while the handle used will be a unique identifier linked to the bank of the registered intermediaries. The same has been illustrated below with examples:\n- i. Username: An intermediary will select a username that is readable and relatable to them as per their presence in the respective segments of the  securities  market,  which  will  be  followed  by  an  abbreviation representing their intermediary segment.\n\nExample: abc.brk, if  an  intermediary  ' abc '  operating as a broker and xyz .mf, if an intermediary 'xyz' is operating as a mutual fund.\n\nThe list of abbreviations for UPI Username Suffix segregated as per the 'Intermediary  Type'  is  placed  at Annexure  B .  Further,  the  utility  for generating Usernames is detailed in Annexure D . The Usernames can only be generated using this utility.\n\n- ii. UPI  Handle: To  make  it  convenient  for  investors  to  identify,  the  UPI address of intermediaries shall use a unique and easily relatable handle '@valid' , combined with the name of the self-certified syndicate banks as mentioned in Annexure C . These handles will be allocated by NPCI.\n\nAccordingly,  continuing  with  the  example  in  point  (i),  the  complete handle, say for a registered broker and mutual fund, will respectively look like: abc.bkr@validhdfc, xyz.mf@validhdfc\n\n- 2.2.  For the payments made to registered market intermediaries, through the above UPI handle, a 'thumbs-up inside a green triangle' icon, as depicted below, shall be available.\n\nIt  is  envisaged that the above icon will further assure the investors that the payments are being made to the verified registered market intermediaries and at the same time its absence would caution investors of the risk that they are making payments to unauthorised entities.\n\n## 3. Framework for Allocation and Use of @valid UPI Handles\n\n- 3.1.  UPI IDs with the handle @valid shall be exclusively designated for payment collection  by  intermediaries  registered  with  SEBI  under  merchant  category code 6211. The usage of these UPI handles for any activity other than the intended payment collection shall not be permitted.  The detailed operational guidelines regarding the issuance  and  use  of such  handles  shall  be communicated by NPCI through appropriate channels.\n- 3.2.  The  self-certified  syndicate  banks  shall  initiate  request  to  NPCI  for  the issuance  of  new  UPI  handles  in  accordance  with  the  prevailing  handle issuance policy at NPCI.  Intermediaries will be able to use their existing bank accounts to obtain the UPI IDs from the syndicate banks and opening of new bank accounts is not necessary. Further, only the self-certified syndicate banks as mentioned in Annexure C will be allocated '@valid' handles by NPCI.\n\n## 4. Transaction Limits\n\n- 4.1.  UPI, being a retail product, has certain transaction limits. Each app and bank impose its own limits; however, upper limits are set by NPCI. At present, this limit for capital market transactions is in the range of ₹2 lakhs - ₹5 lakhs per day.\n- 4.2.  Based on our analysis and available limits on transaction amount through UPI, the upper limit of up to ₹5 lakhs per day for capital market transactions (done through  UPI)  shall  be  available,  subject  to  periodic  review  and  further evaluation as necessary.\n\n## 5. Mechanism to Verify UPI IDs and Bank Account Details of Intermediaries\n\n- 5.1.  In order to provide an additional layer of security and help investors verify the authenticity of an entity before proceeding with any financial transaction, SEBI is in the process of developing a functionality named ' SEBI Check '.\n- 5.2.  This functionality will allow investors to verify the authenticity of UPI IDs either by scanning a QR code or by entering the UPI ID manually.\n\n- 5.3.  This tool will also include a feature to confirm the bank details such as bank account number and Indian Financial System Code (IFSC) of an intermediary.\n\n## 6. Responsibilities of Intermediaries, Self-Certified Syndicate Banks, MIIs and RTAs\n\n## 6.1.  Investor Facing Intermediaries\n\nThe  intermediaries  enlisted  in Annexure  B are  required  to  take  note  of  the following:\n\n- 6.1.1.  Ensure that their mobile number and email address are updated in the SI Portal.  However,  an  intermediary  is  free  to  have  multiple  business accounts, and each account can have its own unique UPI ID.\n- 6.1.2.  The intermediaries need to obtain new UPI IDs from the banks and they will be able to use the old handles in parallel for the duration as specified in Section 6 , post which the old handles have to be discontinued.\n- 6.1.3.  The existing mode of fund transfer for the ongoing Mutual Funds SIPs will continue to remain in force to avoid any disruption. However, new SIPs and renewal or extension of existing SIPs must be done using the new UPI IDs only.\n- 6.1.4.  Create  investor  awareness  about new  payment  handles  and ' SEBI Check '  functionality  through  modes  like  SMS,  e-mail  communications, social  media  posts  and  audio-visual  messages.  These  should  include clear and prominent displays on websites, aimed at empowering investors with detailed information about the presence of unique and secured UPI handle for payments to intermediaries. A few examples in this regard have been placed at Annexure E .\n- 6.1.5.  Create  awareness  and  educational  content  for  investors  by  placing relevant FAQs on the respective websites. A few examples in this regard have been placed at Annexure F .\n\n## 6.2.  Self-Certified Syndicate Banks\n\n- 6.2.1.  Obtain API access which will function as per the details provided, and to issue  the  UPI  ID  only  after  verification  using  the  utility  as  shown  in Annexure D .\n- 6.2.2.  Do proper due diligence while issuing the UPI IDs as per the procedure described in Section 3 .\n\n## 6.3.  MIIs and RTAs\n\n- 6.3.1.  MIIs  are  required  to  make  necessary  changes  at  their  end  to  enable intermediaries to access SI Portal through them.\n- 6.3.2.  Create  investor  awareness  about new  payment  handles  and ' SEBI Check '  functionality  through  modes  like  SMS,  e-mail  communications, social  media  posts  and  audio-visual  messages.  These  should  include clear and prominent displays on websites, aimed at empowering investors with detailed information about the presence of unique and secured UPI handle for payments to intermediaries. A few examples in this regard have been placed at Annexure E .\n- 6.3.3.  Create  awareness  and  educational  content  for  investors  by  placing relevant FAQs on the respective websites. A few examples in this regard have been placed at Annexure F .\n\n## 7.

The following steps describe the generation of UPI IDs and QR codes by intermediaries:\n\n## STEP 1: GENERATE USERNAME\n\n- a.  The  intermediary  needs  to  enter  their  business  name  as  per  the  SEBI registration certificate or registered trademark, based on their preference.\n- b.  Subsequently, the intermediaries need to validate the same for any errors, post which the form will be submitted.\n- c. The request will be sent to the respective bank of the intermediary for approval and allocation of the handle.\n\nRegistered Number\n\nRegistered Name\n\nUse Registered Trademark\n\nTrademark For Handle\n\nTrademark Registration No\n\n| A/C          | IFSC   | USERNAME     | SUFFIX   | HANDLE   | COMPLETE UPI ID           |\n|--------------|--------|--------------|----------|----------|---------------------------|\n| XXXXXXXXXXXX | XXXXX  | abcbroker    | brk      | validybl | abcbroker brk@validybl    |\n| yyYYYYYYYYYY | XXXXX  | abcbroker276 | brk      | validybl | abcbroker276.brk@validyb  |\n| XXXXXXXXXXXX | XXXXX  | abcbroker276 | brk      | validyes | abcbroker276.brk@validyes |\n\n## STEP 2: GENERATE QR CODE\n\nOn SI portal, the intermediaries will be able to see the handles approved by their respective  bank.  Subsequently,  intermediaries  will  be  able  to  generate  and download a QR code from the tab placed next to it.\n\nAn indicative QR code has been placed below:\n\nUPI ID: abcbroker276.brk@validhdfc\n\nAnnexure E\n\n## Examples for Standard Template Based Communications\n\n## Examples for Digital Communications\n\n- i. \"We have a validated UPI ID for payment, please pay us at &lt;&lt;New UPI ID&gt;&gt;.\"\n- ii. \"To make your payments secure, we got a validated UPI handle &lt;&lt;New UPI ID&gt;&gt;.\"\n\n## Examples for Print Communications\n\n- i. \"We are using a validated UPI ID for payment, please prefer to pay us at &lt;&lt;New UPI ID&gt;&gt;.\"\n- ii. \"Securities Market has validated UPI IDs, please prefer to use them making your payments secure. Click here for more details.\"\n- iii. \"The market now has new validated and exclusive UPI IDs, visit our website to know more.\"\n\nAnnexure F\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n## INTERMEDIARIES\n\n## Q. Is it compulsory for the intermediaries to obtain these UPI IDs?\n\nAns. Yes, it is mandatory for all intermediaries to obtain these UPI IDs. The overall process has been described in Annexure A . A temporary record will be created in SEBI's system once an intermediary request for it through SI portal, and the same  will  be  moved  to  final  records  upon  confirmation  from  the  bank.  The intermediaries  also  need  to  make  investors  aware  of  the  new  handle  and mandatorily offer it as one of the payment options to them.\n\n## Q. What will happen to the payments done through existing UPI IDs of the intermediaries?\n\nAns. The intermediaries will have to stop accepting payments using the current UPI IDs post the specified deadline. While, the existing mode of fund transfer for the  ongoing  Mutual  Funds  SIPs  will  continue  to  remain  in  force  to  avoid  any disruption, the new SIPs and renewal or extension of existing SIPs must be done using the new UPI IDs only.\n\n## Q. Do I need to use the utility being provided?\n\nAns. Intermediaries have to use the utility to check for their preferred username. However, the allocation of the preferred username will be subject to its availability.\n\n## Q. Is it mandatory to generate a QR code?\n\nAns. Yes, it is mandatory to generate a QR code with the \"thumbs-up\" logo for the convenience of investors, as scanning a QR code is more secure and reliable.\n\n## Q. Can I use the same username with multiple banks or handles?\n\nAns. The utility will allow the same username to be valid across different banks, for example abc.brk@validhdfc and abc.brk@validicici. However, it needs to be unique at a bank level.\n\n## Q.  Is  it  mandatory  to  have  suffix  (as  mentioned  in  Annexure  B)  in  the Username?\n\nAns. Yes, it is mandatory to have the suffix as it will enable investors to easily identify the category of the registered intermediary they are dealing with. This will be automatically added by the SI portal as per the login details of the intermediary.\n\n## Q. Can I apply for different UPI IDs from my single login in SI portal?\n\nAns. Yes, an intermediary can apply to multiple banks using the same login in the SI portal. However, if the intermediary has registration under different categories, they will be required to apply for the handles for each category separately.\n\n## Q. For how many accounts do I need to generate '@valid' UPI IDs?\n\nAns. An intermediary is expected to generate '@valid' UPI ID for all accounts in which  the  funds  are  received  from  investors.  It  is  also  mandatory  for  an intermediary to add atleast one account for each category-wise login they have and generate '@valid' UPI ID for the same.\n\n## INVESTORS\n\n## Q. Is it compulsory for the investors to use the new handle only?\n\nAns. The investors can choose their preferred mode of payment, such as UPI, IMPS, NEFT, RTGS, or Cheques. If an investor opts to use UPI for the payment to registered intermediaries, then they have to do so only using the new UPI IDs allotted to registered intermediaries.\n\n## Q. What should I check while making payment using the new UPI IDs/ QR Code?\n\nAns. Investors need to keep following things into consideration:\n\n1.  The UPI ID should properly show the name of the intermediary, followed by the short abbreviation of their category for example 'brk' for Brokers, 'mf' for Mutual Funds to the left of the '@' character.\n2.  On the right side of the '@', the new and exclusive handle ' @valid ' should be present, followed by the bank name.\n3.  On the confirmation  screen,  the  app  should  show  a  white  thumbs-up  icon inside a green triangle.\n4.  The QR code generated using the utility will have a white thumbs-up icon inside a green triangle. It will also display the UPI ID just below the QR code.\n- Q.  Do  investors  also  need  to  obtain  new  UPI  handles  to  transact  in  the securities market?\n\nAns. No, the new UPI IDs are only for intermediaries to obtain and investors can continue to use their existing UPI IDs.\n\n- Q. Whom to approach if my transaction/ payment fails with the new UPI ID?\n\nAns. The secure validated UPI ID of intermediaries will use the same banking channel  as  the  earlier  generic  UPI  handles.  In  case  of  any  technical  difficulty, investors are requested to approach their respective bank.\n\n## BANKS\n\n## Q. How to generate the UPI ID for customers/clients?\n\nAns. Once the systems are ready to issue the validated UPI IDs, you are expected to refer to the details mentioned in Annexure D on the process of generating a username and UPI ID.\n\n## Q.  Should  we  discontinue  the  older  UPI  IDs  of  intermediaries  used  for payment?\n\nAns. The  timelines  with  respect  to  discontinuation  of  use  of  old  UPI  IDs  by intermediaries  has  been  mentioned  in  Para  7.  Therefore,  banks  need  not discontinue the old UPI IDs as of now.\n\n## Q. Is it compulsory to use the provided utility for generating Username and UPI ID?\n\nAns. Yes, the username has to be created using the utility as it will ensure that the  username  matches  with  the  business  name  provided  by  the  registered intermediary  and  as  a  result  the  investors  will  be  able  to  easily  identify  the intermediary.\n\n*****",

Objective\n\n- 1.1.  Keeping in view the significant advancements in payment systems and with an objective to further enhance accessibility and safety in the securities market, it has been decided to put in place a structured Unified Payment Interface ('UPI') address mechanism for SEBI-registered investor-facing intermediaries (' intermediaries ') to collect funds from their investors. This mechanism shall provide investors with the option to transfer funds directly to the requisite bank accounts of intermediaries that have been validated with SEBI. The transfer of funds through this mechanism will assure investors that their payments are being made to the verified and registered market intermediaries.\n- 1.2.  This  initiative  is  being  operationalized  pursuant  to  public  consultation  and extensive  deliberations  with  relevant  stakeholders,  including  the  National Payments  Corporation  of  India  (NPCI)  and  the  SCSBs.  The  operational procedure  for  implementing  this  structured  UPI  address  framework by intermediaries is detailed in the subsequent sections of this circular. Additionally,  a  flowchart  outlining  the  end-to-end  process,  along  with  key decision points related to the allocation and implementation of structured UPI IDs, is provided at Annexure A .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.3.  While  the  use  of  this  structured  UPI  mechanism  by  investors  shall  remain optional, it is mandatory for intermediaries to obtain and make available this structured UPI address to their investors . Additionally, intermediaries are advised and encouraged to actively promote and facilitate the adoption of this mechanism among their investors.\n\n## 2. Structure of the Dedicated UPI Address\n\n- 2.1.  A  UPI  address  (UPI ID) is typically  made up of a  Username and a handle, separated  by  an  '@'  symbol.  In  this  mechanism,  Username  will  be  an alphanumeric ID that will be generated for the user while the handle used will be a unique identifier linked to the bank of the registered intermediaries. The same has been illustrated below with examples:\n- i. Username: An intermediary will select a username that is readable and relatable to them as per their presence in the respective segments of the  securities  market,  which  will  be  followed  by  an  abbreviation representing their intermediary segment.\n\nExample: abc.brk, if  an  intermediary  ' abc '  operating as a broker and xyz .mf, if an intermediary 'xyz' is operating as a mutual fund.\n\nThe list of abbreviations for UPI Username Suffix segregated as per the 'Intermediary  Type'  is  placed  at Annexure  B .  Further,  the  utility  for generating Usernames is detailed in Annexure D . The Usernames can only be generated using this utility.\n\n- ii. UPI  Handle: To  make  it  convenient  for  investors  to  identify,  the  UPI address of intermediaries shall use a unique and easily relatable handle '@valid' , combined with the name of the self-certified syndicate banks as mentioned in Annexure C . These handles will be allocated by NPCI.\n\nAccordingly,  continuing  with  the  example  in  point  (i),  the  complete handle, say for a registered broker and mutual fund, will respectively look like: abc.bkr@validhdfc, xyz.mf@validhdfc\n\n- 2.2.  For the payments made to registered market intermediaries, through the above UPI handle, a 'thumbs-up inside a green triangle' icon, as depicted below, shall be available.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt  is  envisaged that the above icon will further assure the investors that the payments are being made to the verified registered market intermediaries and at the same time its absence would caution investors of the risk that they are making payments to unauthorised entities.\n\n## 3. Framework for Allocation and Use of @valid UPI Handles\n\n- 3.1.  UPI IDs with the handle @valid shall be exclusively designated for payment collection  by  intermediaries  registered  with  SEBI  under  merchant  category code 6211. The usage of these UPI handles for any activity other than the intended payment collection shall not be permitted.  The detailed operational guidelines regarding the issuance  and  use  of such  handles  shall  be communicated by NPCI through appropriate channels.\n- 3.2.  The  self-certified  syndicate  banks  shall  initiate  request  to  NPCI  for  the issuance  of  new  UPI  handles  in  accordance  with  the  prevailing  handle issuance policy at NPCI.  Intermediaries will be able to use their existing bank accounts to obtain the UPI IDs from the syndicate banks and opening of new bank accounts is not necessary. Further, only the self-certified syndicate banks as mentioned in Annexure C will be allocated '@valid' handles by NPCI.\n\n## 4. Transaction Limits\n\n- 4.1.  UPI, being a retail product, has certain transaction limits. Each app and bank impose its own limits; however, upper limits are set by NPCI. At present, this limit for capital market transactions is in the range of ₹2 lakhs - ₹5 lakhs per day.\n- 4.2.  Based on our analysis and available limits on transaction amount through UPI, the upper limit of up to ₹5 lakhs per day for capital market transactions (done through  UPI)  shall  be  available,  subject  to  periodic  review  and  further evaluation as necessary.\n\n## 5. Mechanism to Verify UPI IDs and Bank Account Details of Intermediaries\n\n- 5.1.  In order to provide an additional layer of security and help investors verify the authenticity of an entity before proceeding with any financial transaction, SEBI is in the process of developing a functionality named ' SEBI Check '.\n- 5.2.  This functionality will allow investors to verify the authenticity of UPI IDs either by scanning a QR code or by entering the UPI ID manually.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5.3.  This tool will also include a feature to confirm the bank details such as bank account number and Indian Financial System Code (IFSC) of an intermediary.\n\n## 6. Responsibilities of Intermediaries, Self-Certified Syndicate Banks, MIIs and RTAs\n\n## 6.1.  Investor Facing Intermediaries\n\nThe  intermediaries  enlisted  in Annexure  B are  required  to  take  note  of  the following:\n\n- 6.1.1.  Ensure that their mobile number and email address are updated in the SI Portal.  However,  an  intermediary  is  free  to  have  multiple  business accounts, and each account can have its own unique UPI ID.\n- 6.1.2.  The intermediaries need to obtain new UPI IDs from the banks and they will be able to use the old handles in parallel for the duration as specified in Section 6 , post which the old handles have to be discontinued.\n- 6.1.3.  The existing mode of fund transfer for the ongoing Mutual Funds SIPs will continue to remain in force to avoid any disruption. However, new SIPs and renewal or extension of existing SIPs must be done using the new UPI IDs only.\n- 6.1.4.  Create  investor  awareness  about new  payment  handles  and ' SEBI Check '  functionality  through  modes  like  SMS,  e-mail  communications, social  media  posts  and  audio-visual  messages.  These  should  include clear and prominent displays on websites, aimed at empowering investors with detailed information about the presence of unique and secured UPI handle for payments to intermediaries. A few examples in this regard have been placed at Annexure E .\n- 6.1.5.  Create  awareness  and  educational  content  for  investors  by  placing relevant FAQs on the respective websites. A few examples in this regard have been placed at Annexure F .\n\n## 6.2.  Self-Certified Syndicate Banks\n\n- 6.2.1.  Obtain API access which will function as per the details provided, and to issue  the  UPI  ID  only  after  verification  using  the  utility  as  shown  in Annexure D .\n- 6.2.2.  Do proper due diligence while issuing the UPI IDs as per the procedure described in Section 3 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6.3.  MIIs and RTAs\n\n- 6.3.1.  MIIs  are  required  to  make  necessary  changes  at  their  end  to  enable intermediaries to access SI Portal through them.\n- 6.3.2.  Create  investor  awareness  about new  payment  handles  and ' SEBI Check '  functionality  through  modes  like  SMS,  e-mail  communications, social  media  posts  and  audio-visual  messages.  These  should  include clear and prominent displays on websites, aimed at empowering investors with detailed information about the presence of unique and secured UPI handle for payments to intermediaries. A few examples in this regard have been placed at Annexure E .\n- 6.3.3.  Create  awareness  and  educational  content  for  investors  by  placing relevant FAQs on the respective websites. A few examples in this regard have been placed at Annexure F .\n\n## 7.

Is it compulsory for the intermediaries to obtain these UPI IDs?\n\nAns. Yes, it is mandatory for all intermediaries to obtain these UPI IDs. The overall process has been described in Annexure A . A temporary record will be created in SEBI's system once an intermediary request for it through SI portal, and the same  will  be  moved  to  final  records  upon  confirmation  from  the  bank.  The intermediaries  also  need  to  make  investors  aware  of  the  new  handle  and mandatorily offer it as one of the payment options to them.\n\n## Q. What will happen to the payments done through existing UPI IDs of the intermediaries?\n\nAns. The intermediaries will have to stop accepting payments using the current UPI IDs post the specified deadline. While, the existing mode of fund transfer for the  ongoing  Mutual  Funds  SIPs  will  continue  to  remain  in  force  to  avoid  any disruption, the new SIPs and renewal or extension of existing SIPs must be done using the new UPI IDs only.\n\n## Q. Do I need to use the utility being provided?\n\nAns. Intermediaries have to use the utility to check for their preferred username. However, the allocation of the preferred username will be subject to its availability.\n\n## Q. Is it mandatory to generate a QR code?\n\nAns. Yes, it is mandatory to generate a QR code with the \"thumbs-up\" logo for the convenience of investors, as scanning a QR code is more secure and reliable.\n\n## Q. Can I use the same username with multiple banks or handles?\n\nAns. The utility will allow the same username to be valid across different banks, for example abc.brk@validhdfc and abc.brk@validicici. However, it needs to be unique at a bank level.\n\n## Q.  Is  it  mandatory  to  have  suffix  (as  mentioned  in  Annexure  B)  in  the Username?\n\nAns. Yes, it is mandatory to have the suffix as it will enable investors to easily identify the category of the registered intermediary they are dealing with. This will be automatically added by the SI portal as per the login details of the intermediary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Q. Can I apply for different UPI IDs from my single login in SI portal?\n\nAns. Yes, an intermediary can apply to multiple banks using the same login in the SI portal. However, if the intermediary has registration under different categories, they will be required to apply for the handles for each category separately.\n\n## Q. For how many accounts do I need to generate '@valid' UPI IDs?\n\nAns. An intermediary is expected to generate '@valid' UPI ID for all accounts in which  the  funds  are  received  from  investors.  It  is  also  mandatory  for  an intermediary to add atleast one account for each category-wise login they have and generate '@valid' UPI ID for the same.\n\n## INVESTORS\n\n## Q. Is it compulsory for the investors to use the new handle only?\n\nAns. The investors can choose their preferred mode of payment, such as UPI, IMPS, NEFT, RTGS, or Cheques. If an investor opts to use UPI for the payment to registered intermediaries, then they have to do so only using the new UPI IDs allotted to registered intermediaries.\n\n## Q. What should I check while making payment using the new UPI IDs/ QR Code?\n\nAns. Investors need to keep following things into consideration:\n\n1.  The UPI ID should properly show the name of the intermediary, followed by the short abbreviation of their category for example 'brk' for Brokers, 'mf' for Mutual Funds to the left of the '@' character.\n2.  On the right side of the '@', the new and exclusive handle ' @valid ' should be present, followed by the bank name.\n3.  On the confirmation  screen,  the  app  should  show  a  white  thumbs-up  icon inside a green triangle.\n4.  The QR code generated using the utility will have a white thumbs-up icon inside a green triangle. It will also display the UPI ID just below the QR code.\n- Q.  Do  investors  also  need  to  obtain  new  UPI  handles  to  transact  in  the securities market?\n\nAns. No, the new UPI IDs are only for intermediaries to obtain and investors can continue to use their existing UPI IDs.\n\n- Q. Whom to approach if my transaction/ payment fails with the new UPI ID?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAns. The secure validated UPI ID of intermediaries will use the same banking channel  as  the  earlier  generic  UPI  handles.  In  case  of  any  technical  difficulty, investors are requested to approach their respective bank.\n\n## BANKS\n\n## Q. How to generate the UPI ID for customers/clients?\n\nAns. Once the systems are ready to issue the validated UPI IDs, you are expected to refer to the details mentioned in Annexure D on the process of generating a username and UPI ID.\n\n## Q.  Should  we  discontinue  the  older  UPI  IDs  of  intermediaries  used  for payment?\n\nAns. The  timelines  with  respect  to  discontinuation  of  use  of  old  UPI  IDs  by intermediaries  has  been  mentioned  in  Para  7.  Therefore,  banks  need  not discontinue the old UPI IDs as of now.\n\n## Q. Is it compulsory to use the provided utility for generating Username and UPI ID?\n\nAns. Yes, the username has to be created using the utility as it will ensure that the  username  matches  with  the  business  name  provided  by  the  registered intermediary  and  as  a  result  the  investors  will  be  able  to  easily  identify  the intermediary.\n\n*****",

SEBI in its Board meeting held on September 30, 2024 had inter-alia approved, the proposal to specify the frameworks for issuance of social bonds, sustainability bonds and  sustainability-linked  bonds,  which  together  with  green  debt  securities,  will  be termed Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Debt Securities. Pursuant to the inputs  and  feedback  of Industry  Standards  Forum  (ISF) 1 ,  the  following  circular  is issued.\n- II. Regulation  2(1)(oa)  of  the  SEBI  (Issue  and  Listing  of  Non-Convertible  Securities) Regulations 2021 ('SEBI NCS Regulations') defines ESG debt securities as under: ' Environment,  Social  and  Governance  Debt  Securities  or  'ESG  Debt  Securities' means green debt securities, social bonds, sustainability bonds, sustainability-linked bonds,  or  any  other  type  of  bonds,  by  whatever  name  called,  that  are  issued  in accordance with such international frameworks as adapted or adjusted to suit Indian requirements  that  are  specified  by  the  Board  from  time  to  time,  and  any  other securities as specified by the Board .'\n- III. Further,  in  terms  of  Regulation  2(1)(q)  of  the  SEBI  NCS  Regulations  'Green  debt security' means a debt security issued for raising funds subject to the conditions as may be specified by the Board from time to time, to be utilised for project(s) and/ or asset(s) falling under certain categories mentioned therein.\n- IV. Regulation 12A of the SEBI NCS Regulations reads as under:\n\n' Issuance of Environment, Social and Governance Debt Securities\n\n1 In line with its commitment to facilitate capital formation in the economy and ease of doing business, SEBI has set up various  Industry  Standards  Forums  including  ISF  for  debt  market,  comprising  of  representatives  from  Industry Associations under the aegis of the Stock Exchanges. The ISF would formulate standards for implementation of specific regulations and circulars, based on feedback from industry and stakeholders, in consultation with SEBI.\n\n12A. An issuer desirous of issuing and listing of Environment, Social and Governance Debt Securities shall comply with such conditions as may be specified by the Board.'\n\n- V. In view of the above, in order to facilitate Issuers to raise funds through issuance of ESG debt securities (other than green debt securities), the operational framework for ESG debt securities (other than green debt securities) i.e. social bonds, sustainability bonds and sustainability-linked bonds has been finalized in consultation with Industry Standard Forum. The said framework is given as under:\n1. This  circular  shall  be  applicable  to  Environmental,  Social  and  Governance (ESG)  debt  securities  labelled  as  'social  bonds',  'sustainability  bonds'  and 'sustainability-linked  bonds'  which  are  listed  or  proposed  to  be  listed  on  a recognized stock exchange.\n2. The requirements under this chapter shall be in addition to the requirements specified  in  SEBI  NCS  Regulations  and  SEBI  (Listing  Obligations  and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ('SEBI LODR Regulations').\n3. The debt securities shall be labelled as 'social bonds' or 'sustainability bonds' or 'sustainability-linked bonds' only if the funds raised through the issuance of such debt securities are proposed to be utilised for financing or refinancing projects and/or assets aligned with any of the following recognized standards or fall under the definitions given in the following paras:\n5. (a)  International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Principles / Guidelines;\n6. (b)  Climate Bonds Standard;\n7. (c)  ASEAN Standards;\n8. (d)  European Union Standards; and\n9.

For purposes of SEBI NCS Regulations and SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015 and this Circular, Social Bonds shall have the definition as under: 'Social Bonds' means a debt security issued for raising funds, subject to the conditions as may be specified by the Board from time to time, to be utilised for social project(s) that directly aim to address or mitigate a specific social issue  and/or  seek  to  achieve  positive  social  outcomes  especially  but  not exclusively for a target population, falling under any of the following categories:\n- a) Affordable basic infrastructure (e.g. clean drinking  water,  sewers, sanitation, transport, energy)\n- b) Access  to  essential  services  (e.g.  health,  education  and  vocational training, healthcare,)\n- c) Affordable housing\n- d) Employment  generation  and  programmes  designed  to  prevent  and/or alleviate  unemployment  stemming  from  socioeconomic  crises,  climate transition projects and/or other considerations for a 'just transition' (such\n\nprovision and/or promotion could include SME financing and microfinance)\n\n- e) Food security and sustainable food systems (e.g. physical, social, and economic access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food that meets dietary needs and requirements; resilient agricultural practices; reduction of food loss and waste; and improved productivity of small-scale producers)\n- f) Socioeconomic advancement and empowerment (e.g. equitable access to  and  control  over  assets,  services,  resources,  and  opportunities; equitable  participation  and  integration  into  the  market  and  society, including reduction of income inequality)\n- g) any other category, as may be specified by the Board from time to time.\n5. For purposes of SEBI NCS Regulations and SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015 and this Circular, Sustainability bonds shall have the definition as under:\n5. 'Sustainability bonds' means a debt security issued for raising funds, subject to the conditions as may be specified by the Board from time to time, to be utilised for finance or re-finance of a combination of eligible green project(s) and social project(s) as specified under the definition of green bonds and social bonds respectively.\n6. For purposes of SEBI NCS Regulations and SEBI LODR Regulations, 2015 and this Circular, Sustainability-linked bonds shall have the definition as under:\n7. 'Sustainability-linked  bonds'  means  a  debt  security  which  has  its  financial and/or structural characteristics linked to predefined sustainability objectives of  the  Issuer,  subject  to  the  condition  that  such  objectives  are  measured through  predefined  Sustainability  Key  Performance  Indicators  (KPIs) 2   and assessed against predefined Sustainability Performance Targets (SPTs) 3 .\n7. Certain  social  projects  may  also  have  environmental  co-benefits,  and  that certain green projects may have social co-benefits. The classification of a debt security as a green debt security, social bond or sustainability bond should be determined by the issuer based on its primary objectives for the underlying projects.\n8. Initial disclosure requirements, continuous post-listing obligations and appointment  of  independent  third-party  reviewer/  certifier  for  social bonds :\n\nAn issuer desirous of issuing social bonds shall make the disclosures specified in part  I  of  Annexure-A in  the  offer  document  for  public  issues/  private\n\n2\n\nKPI: Key Performance Indicators are quantifiable metrics used to measure the performance of selected indicators. 3 SPT: Sustainability Performance Targets are measurable improvements in key performance indicators on to which issuers commit with a predefined timeline. SPTs should be ambitious, material and where possible benchmarked and consistent with an issuer's overall sustainability/ESG strategies or sustainable development policies.\n\nplacements in addition to adhering to the obligations in accordance with the relevant international standards that the securities are aligned/ issued with. An issuer  who  has  listed  social  bonds  shall  provide  continuous  disclosures  as specified in part II of Annexure-A in its annual report and financial results in addition  to  adhering  to  the  obligations  in  accordance  with  the  relevant international standards that the securities are aligned/ issued with.

SEBI, vide circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2020/28 dated February 25, 2020 (hereinafter  mentioned  as  'Circular')  and  Para  41  of  Master  Circular  for  Stock Brokers  dated  August  09,  2024  (hereinafter  mentioned  as  'Master  Circular'), mandated that the broker shall accept collateral from client in the form of securities only  by  the  way  of  'margin  pledge'.  The  operational  mechanism  for  initiation, release and invocation of margin pledge is provided at Annexure A of the circular and para 41.11 of the Master Circular.\n2.  It has come to notice that after invocation of client's securities pledged in favor of demat account of brokers (i.e. 'Client Securities Margin Pledge Account' or 'Client Securities under Margin Funding Account'), such invoked shares are lying unsold resulting into the accumulation of clients' securities in demat account of the broker. The  said  accumulation  does  not  serve  the  purpose  for  which  securities  were invoked i.e. realization of moneys.\n3.  Further, Brokers' Industry Standard Forum (Brokers' ISF) highlighted operational difficulties  of  brokers  where  clients  sell  the  pledged  securities.  In  the  current process, broker has to first un-pledge the securities sold by the client and thereafter\n\nsecurities are delivered to Clearing Corporation by broker using physical instruction or electronic instruction or DDPI/POA.\n\n4.  Based on the aforesaid observation/representation of Brokers' ISF and with a view to facilitate ease of doing business as well as to safeguard the interest of investors, it  has been decided to make the invocation and sale as a combined automated process. For this, the below given clauses are inserted in Annexure A of circular dated February 25, 2020 and Master circular for stock brokers:\n- a.  Point  9  (in  Annexure  A  of  the  circular  dated  February  25,  2020)  and  Para 41.11.9 (Master circular for stock brokers):\n\nIn case where client sells the securities, which are pledged in favor of TM/CM as Margin pledged securities (including pledged funded stock) / CUSPA pledge, depositories  shall  provide  a  functionality  of  single  instruction  in  the  form  of 'Pledge release for early pay in' to TM/CM wherein pledge will be released and early pay in block will be set up immediately in client demat account subject to pay in validation i.e. only to the extent of delivery obligation of that client as provided by CCs to depositories without the need for physical instruction or electronic instruction or DDPI/POA.\n\n- b.  Point  16  (in  Annexure  A  of  the  circular  dated  February  25,  2020)  and  Para 41.11.16 (Master circular for stock brokers):\n\nIn case of invocation of margin pledged securities (including pledged funded stock)  of  client  by  Trading  member  (TM),  the  invoked  securities,  other  than mutual fund units that are not traded on the exchanges, shall be blocked for early  pay-in  in  the  client's  demat  account  with  a  trail  being  maintained  in TM/CM's 'Client Securities Margin Pledge Account' / 'Client Securities under Margin Funding Account'. The pay in block in client's demat account shall be subject to pay in validation i.e. only to the extent of delivery obligation of that client as provided by CCs to depositories.\n\nIn  case  of  invocation  of  Mutual  fund  (MF)  units  that  are  not  traded  on  the exchange, depositories shall provide a functionality of single instruction in the form of 'invocation cum redemption' wherein invoked MF units will come to the TM/CM's 'Client Securities Margin Pledge Account', and go for auto redemption from the said account.\n\nIn scenarios, where client's trading account is frozen or client trading codes are marked  as  'Not  permitted  to  trade'  or  equivalent  at  the  stock  exchanges subsequent to creation of pledge,  the invoked securities will come to demat account of TM/CM and the same shall be sold by TM/CM under the proprietary code.  In  order  to  prevent  the  accumulation  of  client  securities  in  the  demat account of TM/CM, it must be ensured by TM/CM that pay-in of securities is done on the same day of invocation.\n\n5.  Accordingly, Annexure A of SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2020/28 dated February 25, 2020 and Para 41 of Master Circular for Stock Brokers dated August 09, 2024 stand amended to the extent of para 4 as detailed above.
