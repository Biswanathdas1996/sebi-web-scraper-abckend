SEBI vide circular CIR/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2017/73 dated June 30,\n2017(hereinafter mentioned as ‘Circular’) and para 14 of Master Circular for stock\nbrokers dated June 17, 2025 (hereinafter mentioned as ‘Master Circular’), specified\nprovisions pertaining to policy for annual inspection of members.\n2. Presently, annual inspection of stock brokers/ depository participants\n(‘Brokers’/DPs) are conducted by each of the MIIs (Stock\nExchanges/Depositories/Clearing Corporations) separately. Such an exercise\nunwarrantedly taxes the intermediaries due to frequent visits for inspections by\ndifferent MIIs which result in disproportionate diversion of resources leading to\ndisruption in the routine operations of the entities.\n3. Accordingly, in order to ensure ease of doing business and to take comprehensive\nview of entity’s operations across all MIIs along with optimum utilization of\nresources, the following has been decided\nI. Joint annual inspection instead of separate inspections by MIIs:\nEntities selected for annual inspections shall be inspected for all segments\njointly by all exchanges along with their depository participant (DP) operations\n(if broker is also registered as DP) and clearing activity (if the broker is\nPage 1 of 4\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nundertaking clearing for other brokers). DP operations and clearing activity\nundertaken by entities shall be inspected by Depositories and Clearing\nCorporations, respectively.\nThis will ensure that entities selected by MIIs for their annual inspection shall\nbe inspected jointly by all MIIs at one time.\nII. Information sharing mechanism:\nIn order to improve the effectiveness of supervision, MIIs shall establish an\ninformation sharing mechanism with one another for sharing of inspection\nobservations of entities who hold multiple registrations with MIIs.\nIII. Rationalization and streamlining of criteria for selection of entities:\ni. It has been decided to revise the criteria for annual inspection as follows:\na. Top 25 entities paying high and recurring penalties for non-reporting or\nshort reporting of margin/Client Code modification/CTCL mismatch\nfines or any other similar high risk compliance issue - shall be\ninspected irrespective of when they were last inspected.\nb. Top 25 entities in terms of investor complaints and arbitration cases\nfiled by investors, as percentage of number of active clients shall be\ninspected irrespective of the fact of when they were last inspected.\nc. Top 25 entities based on ‘High risk score’ under Risk Based\nSupervision.\nii. Entities that do not fall under any of the above categories shall be inspected\nby the MIIs at least once in three years.\niii. However, entities inspected in preceding two years by any of the MII’s/SEBI\nand/or entities that have not executed a single trade during last two financial\nyears may not be considered for inspection under the above criteria.\niv. Irrespective of the above, inspections of Professional Clearing Members\nshall be conducted jointly by Clearing Corporations once in two years.\nPage 2 of 4\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n4. Notwithstanding the above, MIIs shall have the prerogative to carry out special\npurpose/limited inspections based on any triggers like patterns found during\ninvestor complaint resolution/Arbitration, complaints on specific malpractices of a\nbroker or references from various authorities. The inspection shall be irrespective\nof the fact of when the last inspection was carried out.\n5. MIIs are advised to frame a joint Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) by\nNovember 01, 2025 for detailed specifications of inspection criteria, information\nsharing mechanism and designating one MII as a ‘Lead MII’, which will initiate\nenforcement action for such inspections.\n6. MIIs are advised to continuously review the policy of annual inspection and revise,\nas and when required, in consultation with SEBI.\n7. Qualified Stock Brokers (QSBs) shall continue to be governed by SEBI circular on\n‘Enhanced obligations and responsibilities on QSBs’ dated February 06, 2023 and\nany changes issued from time to time by SEBI/exchanges.\n8. With the issuance of this circular, SEBI Circular\nCIR/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD2/CIR/P/2017/73 dated June 30, 2017 stands rescinded\nand para 14 of Master Circular for Stock Brokers dated June 17, 2025 stands\namended as per this circular.\n9. The provisions of this circular shall come into force with effect from December 01,\n2025.\n10. MIIs are directed to make amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and\nregulations for the implementation of above directions.\n11. This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11(1) of\nChapter IV of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, and Section\n19 of Chapter IV of the Depositories Act, 1996 read with Regulation 51 of Securities\nContracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations,\n2018 to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the\ndevelopment of, and to regulate the securities markets.\nPage 3 of 4\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n12.

SEBI, vide Para II of Circular no. SEBI/DNPD/Cir-17/2003/10/29 dated October 29,\n2003 (hereinafter mentioned as ‘circular’), inter alia, specified the operational\nmodalities of monitoring of NRI position limits which required NRIs to notify the\nnames of the Clearing Member/s for clearing derivative trades to the Exchange and\nassignment of a unique client code i.e. Custodial Participant (CP) Code to the NRI\nby the Exchange. The Exchange, in turn, would use this information to monitor the\nposition limits of such NRI clients.\n2. As a step towards ease of doing investment and convenience to NRIs for trading\nin exchange traded derivatives contracts, to bring in operational efficiency and in\nline with the recommendation received from Brokers’ Industry Standards Forum, it\nhas been decided to do away with the mandatory requirement of NRIs having to\nnotify the names of the Clearing Member/s and subsequent assignment of CP\nCode to the NRIs by the Exchange. Accordingly, for NRIs trading in exchange\ntraded derivative contracts without CP code, the Exchange/Clearing Corporation\nshall monitor the NRI position limits in the manner similar to the client level position\nlimits monitored by them. Position limits for NRIs shall be same as the client level\nposition limits specified by SEBI from time to time.\nPage 1 of 2\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n3.

This circular is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11(1)\nof Chapter IV of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, read with\nRegulation 30 of Chapter VII of SEBI (Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992 and\nRegulation 51 of Chapter IX of Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges\nand Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2018, and to protect the interests of\ninvestors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the\nsecurities markets.\n5.

Whether brokerage services or merchant banking services provided by\nresearch entity are considered as distribution activity?\nNo. Brokerage services or merchant banking services provided by research\nentity are not considered as distribution activity for the purpose of regulation\n26C of RA Regulations.\n31. Whether RAs/research entity can provide distribution services on the\nproducts/securities on which they are not providing research\nservices/brokerage/merchant banking services to their clients?\nIs client level segregation (i.e. at group level, same client cannot be\nprovided both research as well as distribution service) required if\ndistribution and research services are provided on different categories of\nsecurities?\nAn RA is expected to provide independent, unbiased, and objective research\non securities. It is important to ensure that there is no conflict of interest\nbetween the research activity and other activities of the RA. Purpose of the\nregulation 26C of RA Regulations is to address the inherent concerns on\npotential conflict of interest of RA when it provides both the research and\ndistribution services to their client that may not be in the interest of client. Thus\nin terms of the regulatory intent, RA/research entity cannot provide research\nservices for the securities/products in case it also provides distribution services\nfor such securities/products.\nThus, in alignment with the intent of the regulation, in exercise of power under\nregulation 33 of RA Regulations, it is clarified that RA/research entity can\nprovide distribution services on products/securities provided they are not\nproviding research services on such products/securities being distributed and\nare providing such distribution services through separately identifiable\nPage 13 of 18\n\n--- Page 14 ---\ndepartment or division or business unit within the same entity or through a\nseparate entity on an arms’ length basis.\nSome clarifications with illustrations are given below:\ni. Client level segregation of research and distribution services is not required\nif RA/research entity distributes mutual funds/PMS schemes/AIF products\nbut provides research services only on individual stocks and is not providing\nresearch services on mutual funds/PMS schemes/AIF products. e.g. If a RA\ndistributes 'Mutual Fund Scheme A' at family or group level, it cannot\nprovide research services on 'Mutual Fund Scheme A' and vice versa at\nfamily/group level.\nii. The RA/research entity is required to maintain client level segregation at\nfamily/group level in case it is engaged in providing research services on\nmutual funds and is also engaged in distribution of mutual funds.\niii. RA/research entity may carry out distribution of other products (such as\nbanking products) not under purview of SEBI to their clients at family/group\nlevel. Any grievances related to such products shall not come under\npurview of SEBI.\nNote: For the purpose of abundant clarity, it may be noted that these\nprovisions/clarifications do not restrict distributor of mutual funds from providing\nany investment advice to its clients incidental to its primary activity as\nmentioned under regulation 4(d) of SEBI (Investment Adviser) Regulations,\n2013.\n32. Is NISM certification mandatory for the sales staff, support staff, customer\nsupport team or other client-facing staff not involved in research?\nAs per the explanation to regulation 2(ne) of the RA regulations, all client and\npublic facing persons such as analysts, sales staff, service relationship\nmanagers, client relationship managers, etc., by whatever name called, shall\nbe deemed to be persons associated with research services, but shall not\nPage 14 of 18\n\n--- Page 15 ---\ninclude persons who discharge clerical or office administrative functions if\nwhere there is no connection with research services and they have no client\ncontact.\nIi is clarified that the aforesaid personnel are not considered as persons\nassociated with research services if –\n(i) these personnel while performing activities/services do not have client\ncontact, or\n(ii) these activities/services have no connection with the research services\nprovided as a RA.\nIt shall not be mandatory for such persons to obtain the NISM certification.\nPersons associated with research services shall obtain the relevant certification\nfrom NISM as specified by SEBI within one year from the date of this circular or\nwithin the timeline as may be specified by SEBI.\n33. Whether the following compliance requirements are also applicable in\ncase of non-fee paying clients including institutional investors? -\ni. Disclosure of terms and conditions of research services including\nMost Important Terms and Conditions (MITC) and signing/taking\nconsent of client on these terms and conditions\nii. KYC Requirements\niii. Maintenance of records of interactions with clients such as call\nrecordings, emails, sms\ni. MITC is primarily intended for investors who may not have necessary\nresources to gather necessary information to take informed decision.\nInstitutional investors/Qualified institutional Buyers (QIBs) are sophisticated\ninvestors who have necessary skills, knowledge and means to protect their\ninterests and take informed decisions. Hence, in exercise of power under\nRegulation 33 and for ease of doing business, it is clarified that consent on\nthe terms and conditions including most important terms and conditions\nPage 15 of 18\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n(MITC) of research services shall not be mandatory for the clients who are\ninstitutional investors or QIBs. However, RAs/research entities are required\nto disclose the terms and conditions of research services including MITC to\nthese clients.\nii. RAs/research entities are required to follow the KYC procedure for clients\npaying fees directly for research services.\niii. The requirement of maintenance of records of interactions with clients such\nas call recordings, emails, etc. is applicable for fee-paying as well as non-fee\npaying clients whereas non-fee paying clients are the clients receiving\nresearch services as a value added service along with other services availed\nfrom the research entity or any other entity at family/group level on payable\nbasis. For the purpose of abundant clarity, it is to be stated that call recording\nis not required if the interaction with client is made through means such as\nemail, etc. for which digital footprint is available.\nThe purpose of the records of the client interaction is to document the\ninteraction to cater to potential client grievances related to research services\nprovided by the research analyst/ research entity. Access to an effective\ngrievance redressal mechanism is a basic right of every investor irrespective\nof the nature of the investors i.e. individual/ HUF/ institutions etc. Hence,\nRAs/research entities shall ensure compliance with the provision for\nmaintenance of records of interactions even in case of their clients who are\ninstitutional investors or QIBs.\n34. Whether non-fee paying clients are considered ‘clients’ of research\nentity?\nWhether number of such non-fee paying clients shall be considered as\nclients for the purpose of periodic reporting and determining the deposit\namount to be lien marked to RAASB?\nPage 16 of 18\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nWhether research entity is required to disclose and take consent on the\nterms and conditions for research services from these clients?\nThe term ‘consideration’ under RA regulation is defined as any form of\neconomic benefit including non-cash benefit, received or receivable, directly or\nindirectly, in any form whether from client or otherwise for providing research\nservices.\nNon-fee paying clients are the clients receiving research services as a value\nadded service along with other services availed from the research entity or any\nother entity at family/group level on payable basis. This is also highlighted in\nresponse to FAQ No. 29 above where ‘consideration’ is received indirectly by\nresearch entity.\nThus, the number of clients of RA/research entity shall mean total of fee-paying\nclients and non-fee paying clients of RA/research entity.\nRA/research entity is required to report this number of clients (fee-paying and\nnon-fee paying clients) in periodic reporting format and shall also form basis for\ndetermining the requisite deposit amount applicable to the RA/research entity.\nThe research entity is required to ensure the compliance with the requirement\nof disclosure of terms and conditions of research services to all such clients\nand to take their consent thereupon, except for clients who are institutional\ninvestors/QIBs for whom mere disclosure shall suffice and there shall be no\nrequirement of seeking their consent to terms and conditions.\n35. Whether the exemption to compliance with client level segregation of\nresearch services and distribution activities is allowed to all entities\noffering services to Institutional clients and not only to entities providing\nresearch services exclusively to institutional clients?\nPage 17 of 18\n\n--- Page 18 ---\nAs per the existing provisions, exemption on compliance with client level\nsegregation of research services and distribution activities is given to only\nentities providing research services exclusively to institutional clients if the client\nsigns a standard waiver.\nInstitutional clients/QIBs are sophisticated investors who have necessary skills,\nknowledge and means to protect their interests and take informed decisions.\nAccordingly, in exercise of power under Regulation 33 of RA Regulations and\nfor ease of doing business, it is clarified that even in cases where research\nservice is not exclusively provided to institutional clients/QIBs, all research\nanalysts/entities are exempted from ‘client level segregation of research and\ndistribution activities’ for their institutional clients/QIBs if such a client provides\na standard waiver. Client may also provide such standard waiver through e-\nmail or any other electronically verifiable mode. However, such exemption shall\nnot be applicable in case of clients other than institutional clients/QIBs.\n36. For technical recommendations, whether a mere technical chart with a\ntime stamp shall suffice as a research rationale?\nResearch analyst or research entity are required to maintain the rationale for\narriving at research recommendations. They are required to have adequate\ndocumentary basis, supported by research, for preparing a research report and\nshall ensure that recommendations in the research report are corroborated by\nrelevant data and analysis forming the basis for such research service.\n************************************************************************\nPage 18 of 18",

Transfer of securities in physical mode was discontinued with effect from April 01,\n2019. Subsequently, it was clarified that transfer deeds lodged prior to deadline of\nApril 01, 2019 and rejected/returned due to deficiency in the documents may be\nre-lodged with requisite documents. It was further decided to fix March 31, 2021 as\nthe cut-off date for re-lodgement of transfer deeds.\n2. SEBI received representation from investors as well as RTAs and listed companies\nthat some of the investors had missed the timelines for re-lodging their documents\nfor transfer of securities. This issue was discussed in a Panel of Experts which\nincluded RTAs, listed companies and Legal Expert. Based on discussion, the Panel\nrecommended that to alleviate the issue faced by the investors that missed the\nMarch 31, 2021 deadline for re-lodgement, one more opportunity may be granted\nfor them to re-lodge such shares for transfer.\n3. Thus, in order to facilitate ease of investing for investors and to secure the rights\nof investors in the securities which were purchased by them, it has been decided\nto open a special window only for re-lodgement of transfer deeds, which were\nlodged prior to the deadline of April 01, 2019 and rejected/returned/not attended to\nPage 1 of 3\n\n--- Page 2 ---\ndue to deficiency in the documents/process/or otherwise, for a period of six months\nfrom July 07, 2025 till January 06, 2026.\n4. During this period, the securities that are re-lodged for transfer (including those\nrequests that are pending with the listed company / RTA, as on date) shall be\nissued only in demat mode. Due process shall be followed for such transfer-cum-\ndemat requests.\n5. Listed companies, RTAs and Stock Exchanges shall publicize the opening of this\nspecial window through various media including print and social media, on a bi-\nmonthly basis during the six-month period.\n6. RTAs/listed companies shall have focussed teams to attend to such requests.\n7. RTAs/listed companies shall provide reports on:\n7.1 publicity; and\n7.2 shares re-lodged for transfer cum demat in the format specified by SEBI\n(provided at Annexure-A) on monthly basis.\n8.

SEBI vide paragraph 2.9 of the “Master Circular for Mutual Funds” (“the Master\nCircular”) provided the timelines for rebalancing of portfolios of mutual fund\nschemes in the event of deviation from mandated asset allocation mentioned in the\nScheme Information Document (SID) due to passive breaches (occurrence of\ninstances not arising out of omission and commission of AMCs).\n2. The SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 (“the MF Regulations”) and circulars\nissued thereunder prescribe various prudential limits inter alia including issuer\nlimits, group limits and sector limits etc. While active breaches of those limits are\ntreated as clear violations of concerned SEBI MF Regulations/circulars issued\nthereunder and suitable actions are taken, passive breaches of these limits do\noccur due to various reasons such as corporate action, substantial rise/ fall in the\nprice of an underlying scrip, maturity of any underlying security, large redemptions,\netc., which may not be out of omission and commission of AMCs.\n3. In view of the above and based on the recommendation of Mutual Funds Advisory\nCommittee (MFAC), it is clarified that:\nPage 1 of 2\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n3.1. The provisions prescribed under paragraph 2.9 of the Master Circular shall be\napplicable for all types of passive breaches for the actively managed mutual\nfund schemes.\n4.

Objective\n1.1. Keeping in view the significant advancements in payment systems and with an\nobjective to further enhance accessibility and safety in the securities market, it\nhas been decided to put in place a structured Unified Payment Interface (‘UPI’)\naddress mechanism for SEBI-registered investor-facing intermediaries\n(‘intermediaries’) to collect funds from their investors. This mechanism shall\nprovide investors with the option to transfer funds directly to the requisite bank\naccounts of intermediaries that have been validated with SEBI. The transfer of\nfunds through this mechanism will assure investors that their payments are\nbeing made to the verified and registered market intermediaries.\n1.2. This initiative is being operationalized pursuant to public consultation and\nextensive deliberations with relevant stakeholders, including the National\nPayments Corporation of India (NPCI) and the SCSBs. The operational\nprocedure for implementing this structured UPI address framework by\nintermediaries is detailed in the subsequent sections of this circular.\nAdditionally, a flowchart outlining the end-to-end process, along with key\ndecision points related to the allocation and implementation of structured UPI\nIDs, is provided at Annexure A.\nPage 1 of 15\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n1.3. While the use of this structured UPI mechanism by investors shall remain\noptional, it is mandatory for intermediaries to obtain and make available\nthis structured UPI address to their investors. Additionally, intermediaries\nare advised and encouraged to actively promote and facilitate the adoption of\nthis mechanism among their investors.\n2. Structure of the Dedicated UPI Address\n2.1. A UPI address (UPI ID) is typically made up of a Username and a handle,\nseparated by an “@” symbol. In this mechanism, Username will be an\nalphanumeric ID that will be generated for the user while the handle used will\nbe a unique identifier linked to the bank of the registered intermediaries. The\nsame has been illustrated below with examples:\ni. Username: An intermediary will select a username that is readable and\nrelatable to them as per their presence in the respective segments of\nthe securities market, which will be followed by an abbreviation\nrepresenting their intermediary segment.\nExample: abc.brk, if an intermediary ‘abc’ operating as a broker and\nxyz.mf, if an intermediary ‘xyz’ is operating as a mutual fund.\nThe list of abbreviations for UPI Username Suffix segregated as per the\n‘Intermediary Type’ is placed at Annexure B. Further, the utility for\ngenerating Usernames is detailed in Annexure D. The Usernames can\nonly be generated using this utility.\nii. UPI Handle: To make it convenient for investors to identify, the UPI\naddress of intermediaries shall use a unique and easily relatable handle\n“@valid”, combined with the name of the self-certified syndicate banks\nas mentioned in Annexure C. These handles will be allocated by NPCI.\nAccordingly, continuing with the example in point (i), the complete\nhandle, say for a registered broker and mutual fund, will respectively\nlook like: abc.bkr@validhdfc, xyz.mf@validhdfc\n2.2. For the payments made to registered market intermediaries, through the above\nUPI handle, a “thumbs-up inside a green triangle” icon, as depicted below,\nshall be available.\nPage 2 of 15\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nIt is envisaged that the above icon will further assure the investors that the\npayments are being made to the verified registered market intermediaries and\nat the same time its absence would caution investors of the risk that they are\nmaking payments to unauthorised entities.\n3. Framework for Allocation and Use of @valid UPI Handles\n3.1. UPI IDs with the handle @valid shall be exclusively designated for payment\ncollection by intermediaries registered with SEBI under merchant category\ncode 6211. The usage of these UPI handles for any activity other than the\nintended payment collection shall not be permitted. The detailed operational\nguidelines regarding the issuance and use of such handles shall be\ncommunicated by NPCI through appropriate channels.\n3.2. The self-certified syndicate banks shall initiate request to NPCI for the\nissuance of new UPI handles in accordance with the prevailing handle\nissuance policy at NPCI. Intermediaries will be able to use their existing bank\naccounts to obtain the UPI IDs from the syndicate banks and opening of new\nbank accounts is not necessary.

The following steps describe the generation of UPI IDs and\nQR codes by intermediaries:\nSTEP 1: GENERATE USERNAME\na. The intermediary needs to enter their business name as per the SEBI\nregistration certificate or registered trademark, based on their preference.\nb. Subsequently, the intermediaries need to validate the same for any errors, post\nwhich the form will be submitted.\nc. The request will be sent to the respective bank of the intermediary for approval\nand allocation of the handle.\nSTEP 2: GENERATE QR CODE\nOn SI portal, the intermediaries will be able to see the handles approved by their\nrespective bank. Subsequently, intermediaries will be able to generate and\ndownload a QR code from the tab placed next to it.\nPage 10 of 15\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nAn indicative QR code has been placed below:\nPage 11 of 15\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nAnnexure E\nExamples for Standard Template Based Communications\nExamples for Digital Communications\ni. \"We have a validated UPI ID for payment, please pay us at <<New UPI ID>>.\"\nii. \"To make your payments secure, we got a validated UPI handle <<New UPI\nID>>.\"\nExamples for Print Communications\ni. \"We are using a validated UPI ID for payment, please prefer to pay us at <<New\nUPI ID>>.\"\nii. \"Securities Market has validated UPI IDs, please prefer to use them making\nyour payments secure. Click here for more details.\"\niii. \"The market now has new validated and exclusive UPI IDs, visit our website to\nknow more.\"\nPage 12 of 15\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nAnnexure F\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nINTERMEDIARIES\nQ. Is it compulsory for the intermediaries to obtain these UPI IDs?\nAns. Yes, it is mandatory for all intermediaries to obtain these UPI IDs. The overall\nprocess has been described in Annexure A. A temporary record will be created\nin SEBI’s system once an intermediary request for it through SI portal, and the\nsame will be moved to final records upon confirmation from the bank. The\nintermediaries also need to make investors aware of the new handle and\nmandatorily offer it as one of the payment options to them.\nQ. What will happen to the payments done through existing UPI IDs of the\nintermediaries?\nAns. The intermediaries will have to stop accepting payments using the current\nUPI IDs post the specified deadline. While, the existing mode of fund transfer for\nthe ongoing Mutual Funds SIPs will continue to remain in force to avoid any\ndisruption, the new SIPs and renewal or extension of existing SIPs must be done\nusing the new UPI IDs only.\nQ. Do I need to use the utility being provided?\nAns. Intermediaries have to use the utility to check for their preferred username.\nHowever, the allocation of the preferred username will be subject to its availability.\nQ. Is it mandatory to generate a QR code?\nAns. Yes, it is mandatory to generate a QR code with the \"thumbs-up\" logo for the\nconvenience of investors, as scanning a QR code is more secure and reliable.\nQ. Can I use the same username with multiple banks or handles?\nAns. The utility will allow the same username to be valid across different banks,\nfor example abc.brk@validhdfc and abc.brk@validicici. However, it needs to be\nunique at a bank level.\nQ. Is it mandatory to have suffix (as mentioned in Annexure B) in the\nUsername?\nAns. Yes, it is mandatory to have the suffix as it will enable investors to easily\nidentify the category of the registered intermediary they are dealing with. This will\nbe automatically added by the SI portal as per the login details of the intermediary.\nPage 13 of 15\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nQ. Can I apply for different UPI IDs from my single login in SI portal?\nAns. Yes, an intermediary can apply to multiple banks using the same login in the\nSI portal. However, if the intermediary has registration under different categories,\nthey will be required to apply for the handles for each category separately.\nQ. For how many accounts do I need to generate “@valid” UPI IDs?\nAns. An intermediary is expected to generate “@valid” UPI ID for all accounts in\nwhich the funds are received from investors. It is also mandatory for an\nintermediary to add atleast one account for each category-wise login they have\nand generate “@valid” UPI ID for the same.\nINVESTORS\nQ. Is it compulsory for the investors to use the new handle only?\nAns. The investors can choose their preferred mode of payment, such as UPI,\nIMPS, NEFT, RTGS, or Cheques. If an investor opts to use UPI for the payment\nto registered intermediaries, then they have to do so only using the new UPI IDs\nallotted to registered intermediaries.\nQ. What should I check while making payment using the new UPI IDs/ QR\nCode?\nAns. Investors need to keep following things into consideration:\n1. The UPI ID should properly show the name of the intermediary, followed by\nthe short abbreviation of their category for example “brk” for Brokers, “mf” for\nMutual Funds to the left of the “@” character.\n2. On the right side of the “@”, the new and exclusive handle “@valid” should\nbe present, followed by the bank name.\n3. On the confirmation screen, the app should show a white thumbs-up icon\ninside a green triangle.\n4. The QR code generated using the utility will have a white thumbs-up icon\ninside a green triangle. It will also display the UPI ID just below the QR code.\nQ. Do investors also need to obtain new UPI handles to transact in the\nsecurities market?\nAns. No, the new UPI IDs are only for intermediaries to obtain and investors can\ncontinue to use their existing UPI IDs.\nQ. Whom to approach if my transaction/ payment fails with the new UPI ID?\nPage 14 of 15\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nAns. The secure validated UPI ID of intermediaries will use the same banking\nchannel as the earlier generic UPI handles. In case of any technical difficulty,\ninvestors are requested to approach their respective bank.\nBANKS\nQ. How to generate the UPI ID for customers/clients?\nAns. Once the systems are ready to issue the validated UPI IDs, you are expected\nto refer to the details mentioned in Annexure D on the process of generating a\nusername and UPI ID.\nQ. Should we discontinue the older UPI IDs of intermediaries used for\npayment?\nAns. The timelines with respect to discontinuation of use of old UPI IDs by\nintermediaries has been mentioned in Para 7. Therefore, banks need not\ndiscontinue the old UPI IDs as of now.\nQ. Is it compulsory to use the provided utility for generating Username and\nUPI ID?\nAns. Yes, the username has to be created using the utility as it will ensure that\nthe username matches with the business name provided by the registered\nintermediary and as a result the investors will be able to easily identify the\nintermediary.\n*****\nPage 15 of 15",

SEBI, vide circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2020/28 dated February 25, 2020\n(hereinafter mentioned as ‘Circular’) and Para 41 of Master Circular for Stock\nBrokers dated August 09, 2024 (hereinafter mentioned as ‘Master Circular’),\nmandated that the broker shall accept collateral from client in the form of securities\nonly by the way of ‘margin pledge’. The operational mechanism for initiation,\nrelease and invocation of margin pledge is provided at Annexure A of the circular\nand para 41.11 of the Master Circular.\n2. It has come to notice that after invocation of client’s securities pledged in favor of\ndemat account of brokers (i.e. ‘Client Securities Margin Pledge Account’ or ‘Client\nSecurities under Margin Funding Account’), such invoked shares are lying unsold\nresulting into the accumulation of clients’ securities in demat account of the broker.\nThe said accumulation does not serve the purpose for which securities were\ninvoked i.e. realization of moneys.\n3. Further, Brokers’ Industry Standard Forum (Brokers’ ISF) highlighted operational\ndifficulties of brokers where clients sell the pledged securities. In the current\nprocess, broker has to first un-pledge the securities sold by the client and thereafter\nPage 1 of 4\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nsecurities are delivered to Clearing Corporation by broker using physical instruction\nor electronic instruction or DDPI/POA.\n4. Based on the aforesaid observation/representation of Brokers’ ISF and with a view\nto facilitate ease of doing business as well as to safeguard the interest of investors,\nit has been decided to make the invocation and sale as a combined automated\nprocess. For this, the below given clauses are inserted in Annexure A of circular\ndated February 25, 2020 and Master circular for stock brokers:\na. Point 9 (in Annexure A of the circular dated February 25, 2020) and Para\n41.11.9 (Master circular for stock brokers):\nIn case where client sells the securities, which are pledged in favor of TM/CM\nas Margin pledged securities (including pledged funded stock) / CUSPA pledge,\ndepositories shall provide a functionality of single instruction in the form of\n‘Pledge release for early pay in’ to TM/CM wherein pledge will be released and\nearly pay in block will be set up immediately in client demat account subject to\npay in validation i.e. only to the extent of delivery obligation of that client as\nprovided by CCs to depositories without the need for physical instruction or\nelectronic instruction or DDPI/POA.\nb. Point 16 (in Annexure A of the circular dated February 25, 2020) and Para\n41.11.16 (Master circular for stock brokers):\nIn case of invocation of margin pledged securities (including pledged funded\nstock) of client by Trading member (TM), the invoked securities, other than\nmutual fund units that are not traded on the exchanges, shall be blocked for\nearly pay-in in the client’s demat account with a trail being maintained in\nTM/CM’s ‘Client Securities Margin Pledge Account’ / ‘Client Securities under\nMargin Funding Account’. The pay in block in client’s demat account shall be\nsubject to pay in validation i.e. only to the extent of delivery obligation of that\nclient as provided by CCs to depositories.\nPage 2 of 4\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nIn case of invocation of Mutual fund (MF) units that are not traded on the\nexchange, depositories shall provide a functionality of single instruction in the\nform of ‘invocation cum redemption’ wherein invoked MF units will come to the\nTM/CM’s ‘Client Securities Margin Pledge Account’, and go for auto redemption\nfrom the said account.\nIn scenarios, where client’s trading account is frozen or client trading codes are\nmarked as ‘Not permitted to trade’ or equivalent at the stock exchanges\nsubsequent to creation of pledge, the invoked securities will come to demat\naccount of TM/CM and the same shall be sold by TM/CM under the proprietary\ncode. In order to prevent the accumulation of client securities in the demat\naccount of TM/CM, it must be ensured by TM/CM that pay-in of securities is\ndone on the same day of invocation.\n5. Accordingly, Annexure A of SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2020/28\ndated February 25, 2020 and Para 41 of Master Circular for Stock Brokers dated\nAugust 09, 2024 stand amended to the extent of para 4 as detailed above. All other\nprovisions specified in SEBI Circular dated February 25, 2020 and SEBI Master\nCircular for Stock Brokers dated August 09, 2024 shall continue to remain\napplicable.\n6. The provisions of this circular shall come into force with effect from September 05,\n2025.\n7. The detailed operating guidelines shall be specified by depositories on or before\nJuly 01, 2025.\n8. The Stock Exchanges, Clearing corporations and Depositories shall:\n8.1. bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of their members and also\ndisseminate the same on their websites;\n8.2. make necessary amendments to the relevant Bye-laws, Rules and Regulations\nfor the implementation of the above direction;\nPage 3 of 4\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n9.
