              "text": "--- Page 1 ---\nCIRCULAR\nSEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2025/79 May 29, 2025\nTo\nAll Stock Exchanges\nAll Clearing Corporations\n(Except Commodity Derivatives Exchanges and Clearing Corporations)\nSir/Madam,\nMeasures for Enhancing Trading Convenience and Strengthening Risk\nMonitoring in Equity Derivatives\n1. Derivatives market enables efficient price discovery, improved market liquidity and\npermits investors to manage risk. Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations\n(CCs) together provide the platform and products for trading in derivatives market,\nwhile ensuring online real time risk management, adequate surveillance, as well\nas smooth settlement of trades.\n2. The role of product offering, risk management, and surveillance by Stock\nExchanges and Clearing Corporations is crucial in ensuring integrity of securities\nmarket ecosystem. This is specifically pertinent in view of the evolving market\ndynamics in derivatives segment in recent years, with increased retail participation,\noffering of short tenure index options contracts, and heightened trading volumes in\nindex derivatives on expiry day. Regulation 28 (2) read with Part–C of Schedule II\nof the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing\nCorporations) Regulations, 2018 (SECC Regulations, 2018), considers Risk\nManagement, Surveillance, and Product development functions of Stock\nPage 1 of 21\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nExchanges and Clearing Corporations as core functions. In addition, Clearing and\nSettlement is considered as a core function of Clearing Corporations.\n3. The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (“SEBI Act”) mandates SEBI\nto protect the interest of investors in securities and to promote the development of,\nand to regulate the securities market, by such measures as it thinks fit. One of the\nmeans to achieve the aforesaid mandate as provided in the SEBI Act is to regulate\nthe market through measures that enables regulating the business of Stock\nExchanges.\n4. In order to review the existing regulatory measures for investor protection while\nensuring the orderly development and strengthening of equity Futures and Options\n(F&O) market, as well as to identify measures to assist Stock Exchanges in\ncarrying out their aforementioned core functions, SEBI deliberated the matter with\nExpert Working Group (EWG) on derivatives, to improve risk metrics for the\nfollowing objectives:\n4.1. Better monitoring and disclosure of risks in F&O\n4.2. Reduce instances of spurious F&O ban periods in single stocks\n4.3. Better oversight over the possibility of concentration or manipulation risk in\nindex options\n5. On the basis of the measures recommended by the EWG, a consultation paper\nwas issued by SEBI on February 24, 2025, in the matter. The comments received\nwere examined by SEBI and the matter was further deliberated in Secondary\nMarket Advisory Committee (SMAC) along with Stock Exchanges and CCs. Based\non the deliberations, it has been decided to put in place the following measures to\nstrengthen the equity derivatives framework (Implementation timelines provided at\nPara 6 of the circular):\n5.1. Formulation of Open Interest\n5.1.1. Open Interest (OI) of the participants in derivatives shall be measured at\na portfolio level by computing the net Delta adjusted open positions across\nPage 2 of 21\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nfutures and options for an underlying at a given point in time. Delta denotes\nsensitivity of price movement of derivative position with respect to that of\nthe underlying. Accordingly, long futures have a delta of +1 times notional.\nFor options, delta will range between 0 and +1 times notional for long calls\nand between 0 and –1 times notional for long puts. In case of short options\nposition, effective delta for short calls is negative and that of short put is\npositive.\n5.1.2. Gross addition of such net Future Equivalent Open Interest (FutEq OI)\nacross all Unique Client Codes (UCCs) would form the FutEq OI for the\nStock/Index Derivatives, as illustrated in Table 1 below.\nTable 1: Illustration of FutEq OI for various F&O positions\nLong Delta Long Delta Short Delt\nLong Positio of Positio of Positio a of Short Noti\nPosition n in long n in long n in Put Put Positio Delta onal FutEq\nScrip 1 i n F u tures Call Call Put Put n in Call of call OI OI\nClient 1 300 300 300\nClient 2 500 0.5 500 250\nClient 3 300 500 0.5 400 -0.5 1200 350\nClient 4 -400 -0.5 -400 0.5 800 0\nMarket wide OI 2800 900\n5.1.3. CCs have been disseminating FutEq OI for all the scrips/indices on their\nwebsites and have been intimating entity level FutEq OI to participants\nthrough their portal. The same shall be continued for the instant purpose.\n5.2. Definition of Market Wide Position Limit (MWPL)\n5.2.1. As per Clause 3.3.2.1.1 of Chapter 5 of the SEBI Master Circular for Stock\nExchanges and Clearing Corporations dated December 30, 2024, MWPL\nfor single stocks (i.e. aggregate open positions in all futures and all options\ncontracts on a particular underlying stock) is 20% of the number of shares\nheld by non-promoters in the relevant underlying security (i.e. free float\nholding).\n5.2.2. It has been decided to calibrate it to the new formulation of OI\nmeasurement and also link it to cash market activity in the following way:\nPage 3 of 21\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n5.2.3. The MWPL shall be lower of 15% of free float and 65x Average Daily\nDelivery Value (ADDV) across CCs with a floor limit of 10% of free float.\n5.2.4. This metric shall be recalculated every three months based on the rolling\nADDV for the preceding three month period.\n5.2.5. Tying the MWPL to cash market delivery volume will reduce the potential\nmanipulation and better align derivatives risk with the underlying cash\nmarket liquidity.\n5.2.6. As per Clause 3.3.2.1.2.1 of Chapter 5 of the SEBI Master Circular dated\nDecember 30, 2024, the Stock Exchanges are required to test, at the end\nof the day, whether the market wide Open Interest for any scrip exceeds\n95% of the MWPL for that scrip. Henceforth, Stock Exchanges/CCs shall\ntest whether the market wide FutEq OI for any scrip exceeds 95% of the\nproposed MWPL for that scrip.\n5.3. Position Creation for Single Stocks during Ban Period\n5.3.1. As per Clause 3.3.2.1.2.1 of Chapter 5 of the SEBI Master Circular dated\nDecember 30, 2024, once the market wide Open Interest for any scrip\nexceeds 95% of the MWPL for the scrip, the members/clients shall trade\nonly to decrease their positions through offsetting positions (this is called\nban period).\n5.3.2. It has been decided that any trading done by entities in the derivatives\ncontracts of a scrip, subsequent to its entry in the ban period, should result\nin reduction of FutEq OI on end of day basis. For instance, if delta position\nis (+10) or say (-10) at the end of day 1, then it could be reduced till 0 by\nend of day 2. Change in sign of delta value would not be considered an\nacceptable instance of reduction of delta position. Further, passive\nincrease in FutEq OI on account of movement in the scrip shall not be\nconsidered a breach.\n5.3.3. For illustration, assume the position of an entity at the end of day 1 when\nthe scrip went in to ban period in derivatives, as mentioned in the table\nbelow. For subsequent days, the examples of permissible behavior from\nthe perspective of delta reduction is illustrated in Table 2:\nPage 4 of 21\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nTable 2: Illustration of position creation during ban period\nDay EoD Position Comments\n1 Long Futures 1 lot Stock went into ban period EoD day\n1. Delta position is positive. Any\ndecrease till 0 is permissible on\nsubsequent days.\n2 Long Futures 1 lot (with Passive increase in EoD delta by\nunderlying appreciating 5% as no new position is created.\nby 5%) Permissible.\n3 Long Futures 1 lot + Long Overall delta reduction as long put\nPut option 1 lot has negative delta. Permissible.\n4 Long Futures 1 lot + Long Further delta reduction as short call\nPut option 1 lot + Short has negative delta. As long as EoD\nOTM Call option 1 lot delta above 0, permissible.\n5 Long Futures 2 lot + Long Additional Delta creation in positive\nPut option 1 lot + Short side compared to previous day. Not\nCall option 1 lot permissible.\n5.3.4. CCs to prepare a joint SOP, in consultation with SEBI, for monitoring the\nend of day delta position of entities and penalty structure thereof in this\nregard within one month from the date of the circular (Implementation date\nof this measure is mentioned at Para 6 of the circular).\n5.4. Intraday monitoring of MWPL utilization for single stocks\n5.4.1. To safeguard market integrity and limit settlement risk from intraday spikes\nin FutEq OI, Stock Exchanges shall perform intraday monitoring of MWPL\nutilization at least four random times during the trading session to:\n5.4.1.1. take appropriate actions once OI utilization breaches certain limits\nsuch as levying Additional Surveillance Margin, monitoring for entity\nlevel concentration, additional surveillance checks etc.\n5.4.1.2. report instances of significant utilization of MWPL / breach of MWPL\nto SEBI in the fortnightly Surveillance meeting.\nPage 5 of 21\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n5.4.2. Stock Exchanges shall prepare a joint SOP, in consultation with SEBI, in\nthis regard within one month from date of the circular (Implementation date\nof this measure is mentioned at Para 6 of the circular).\n5.5. Position Limits for Index Futures and Index Options\n5.5.1. In order to strike a balance between market stability / fear of manipulation\nof underlying constituents associated with a large size index position and\nthe ability to take meaningful exposure by participants, following limits\nhave been stipulated for index options at PAN level:\n5.5.1.1. Net end of day FutEq OI limit for options to be ₹1,500 cr. and gross\nFutEq OI to be ₹10,000 cr. (i.e. neither gross long FutEq OI nor gross\nshort FutEq OI shall exceed ₹10,000 cr.).\n5.5.1.2. Stock Exchanges shall prepare a joint SOP, in consultation with SEBI,\nto strictly monitor intraday positions and trading activities of major\nparticipants from the perspective of market integrity / surveillance\nconcerns and take appropriate measures.\n5.5.2. In order to facilitate market participants to take meaningful market wide\nexposure and to develop index futures segment further, following position\nlimits are stipulated for index futures:\n5.5.2.1. FPI Category I / Mutual Funds / Trading Member (Proprietary) /\nClients - higher of 15% of futures OI for that index or ₹500 cr.\n5.5.2.2. FPI Category II (other than individuals, family offices and corporates)\n- higher of 10% of futures OI or ₹500 cr.\n5.5.2.3. FPI Category II (Individuals, family offices and corporates) higher of\n5% of futures OI or ₹500 cr.\n5.5.2.4. The above stated position limits for index futures would be measured\non gross notional basis.\n5.5.2.5. As Open Interest of both the participants and the market is dynamic\nand changing throughout the day and with a view to provide better\nclarity to the market participants in terms of their position limits, the\nfollowing has been decided:\nPage 6 of 21\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n5.5.2.5.1. Positions of market participants in the equity derivatives segment\n(index) shall also be monitored based on total Open Interest of\nthe market at the end of previous day’s trade.\n5.5.2.5.2. In case of a drop in market OI compared to the previous day’s\nmarket OI, market participants may breach the specified position\nlimits even if their positions have remained unchanged/reduced\nthroughout the day.\n5.5.2.5.3. Such cases of passive breaches shall not be considered as\nviolation.\n5.5.3. In line with existing practice, in addition to the above specified position\nlimits for index options and index futures, entities shall be allowed to take\nadditional exposure in equity index derivatives subject to the following:\n5.5.3.1. Aggregate short positions in index derivatives (short futures, short\ncalls and long puts) shall not exceed (FutEq terms for Index options\nand gross notional terms for Index futures) the holding of stocks.\n5.5.3.2. Aggregate long positions in index derivatives (long futures, long calls\nand short puts) shall not exceed (FutEq terms for Index options and\ngross notional terms for Index futures) the holding of cash and cash\nequivalent, government securities, T-Bills and similar instruments.\n5.5.3.3. Stock Exchanges / CCs shall prepare a joint SOP, in consultation with\nSEBI, for monitoring the positions of entities including the\npenalty/additional surveillance margin framework for entities\nbreaching the position limits. The SOP shall be prepared within 30\ndays from the date of the Circular and shall also cover the reporting\nframework for entities taking additional exposure beyond the limits\nprescribed at para 5.5.3.1 and 5.5.3.2 of the Circular.\n5.5.4. Considering that market participants may be in the process of designing\nsystems to monitor their FutEq OI, in discussion with market participants\nand Stock Exchanges/CCs, following glide path for implementing aforesaid\nposition limits for index options, shall be provided by Stock Exchanges\nw.e.f. July 01, 2025:\nPage 7 of 21\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n5.5.4.1. By 9 PM on each trading day (T), Stock Exchanges shall intimate the\nentities (and their TM/CM) if the FutEq OI in options on any index is\nbeyond the permissible limit (i.e. ₹1,500 cr. net or ₹10,000 cr. gross\nlong / gross short as mentioned at Para 5.5.1.1 above).\n5.5.4.2. If the entity has long position beyond permissible limits then cash (or\ncash equivalent) would be required to be intimated to Stock\nExchanges / CCs by 12 noon next trading day (T+1).\n5.5.4.3. If the entity has short position beyond permissible limits after\nconsidering the security holding value of T day or long position\nbeyond permissible limits after considering the cash / cash equivalent\nreported by 12 noon on T+1 day, the entity will have to bring down\noptions positions within permissible limit by end of T+1, as per delta\nvalue of derivatives contracts as of end of T+1.\n5.5.4.4. If entities don’t have systems to compute same day delta, bringing\nend of day position on T+1 day within the permissible limit with T day\nmarket close data provided by Stock Exchange for various derivatives\ncontracts, shall also be considered acceptable.\n5.5.4.5. If the entity fails to reduce the position within the permissible limit on\nT+1 day, as mentioned above, the same would attract Additional\nSurveillance Deposit/Penalty as decided by Stock Exchanges.\n5.5.4.6. The aforesaid glide path will be applicable till December 05, 2025,\npost which entities willing to take large delta based positions in index\noptions are expected to have their own delta computing / monitoring\nsystem.\n5.5.4.7. Subsequent to December 05, 2025, the end of day excess position in\nindex options on each day shall be checked by exchanges against the\nholding of securities / reported cash or equivalent on that day. Excess\nposition beyond permissible limits, will attract Additional Surveillance\nDeposit/Penalty, as decided by Stock Exchanges.\n5.5.4.8. It is emphasized that the provision of one day to reduce the position\nbeyond permissible limit is only with the intention to provide time to\nimplement delta monitoring system by entities / trading members who\nwish to take positions close to or beyond permissible limit. It would\nPage 8 of 21\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nnot impact typical retail traders / investors. To that extent, Stock\nExchanges shall discuss the instances of entities repeatedly taking\nexcess position for a day in fortnightly surveillance meeting with SEBI\nto ensure that the instant glide path is not misused by any entity to\ntake large overnight positions beyond permissible limit.\n5.5.4.9. Stock Exchanges/CCs shall submit a joint SOP to SEBI for\noperationalizing position limit monitoring during the aforesaid glide\npath within one month from the date of circular. The said SOP shall\nalso include details of appropriate measures to be taken by Stock\nExchanges in case of repeated instances of position creation by\nentities beyond permissible limit for one day.\n5.5.4.10. Clauses 1.3.2, 1.3.3, 1.3.4 and 1.3.5 of Chapter 5 of SEBI Master\nCircular for Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations dated\nDecember 30, 2024 provide for position limits for index futures and\nClauses 2.3.2, 2.3.3 and 2.3.4 provide for position limits for index\noptions. These clauses are modified to account for the stipulation on\nposition limits for index options and index futures and are reproduced\nat Annexure-1 of the Circular.\n5.6. Pre-open session for the derivatives market\n5.6.1. The pre-open session to be extended to current-month futures contracts\non both single stocks and indices, mirroring the modalities of the cash\nmarket’s pre-open and post-closing sessions.\n5.6.2. In the last five trading days before expiry, these sessions shall extend to\nnext-month futures contracts as liquidity shifts from one expiry to the other\non account of rollover of futures contracts.\n5.7. Eligibility criteria for Derivatives on Non-Benchmark indices\n5.7.1. In addition to the existing eligibility criteria for derivatives on indices,\nspecified in Clause 1.1.2 of Chapter 5 of SEBI Master Circular for Stock\nExchanges and Clearing Corporations dated December 30, 2024, Stock\nExchanges shall follow the following prudential norms before introducing\nderivatives on non-benchmark indices:\nPage 9 of 21\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n5.7.1.1. Minimum of 14 constituents.\n5.7.1.2. Top constituent’s weight ≤ 20%\n5.7.1.3. Combined weight of the top three constituents ≤ 45%\n5.7.1.4. All other constituents’ individual weights must be lower than those\nof the higher-weighted constituents (i.e., a descending weight\nstructure).\n5.7.2. Exchanges shall evaluate and ensure compliance with the aforesaid\nadditional criteria at the end of every calendar quarter. Stock Exchanges\nshall submit their proposal for non-benchmark indices having derivatives\ncontracts on them to SEBI, within 30 days from the date of the circular.\n5.8. Individual Entity-Level Position Limits for Single Stocks\n5.8.1. The existing combined futures and options position limits for single\nstocks which are essentially linked to MWPL, as per Clause 3.3.2 and 4.3.2\nof Chapter 5 of SEBI Master Circular for Stock Exchanges and Clearing\nCorporations dated December 30, 2024, are recalibrated to the new\ndefinition of MWPL as follows:\n5.8.1.1. Client / NRI: 10% of MWPL\n5.8.1.2. Trading Member (Proprietary): 20% of MWPL\n5.8.1.3. Trading Member (Proprietary + Client) / FPI (Category I) / MF: 30%\nof MWPL\n5.8.1.4. FPI (Category II - other than FPIs in sub-category individuals, family\noffices, corporates): 20% of MWPL\n5.8.1.5.

Stock Exchanges / CCs shall prepare a joint SOP, in consultation with SEBI,\nfor monitoring the breach of position limits by the entities.\n2.3.2.2.4.

By 9 PM on each trading day (T), Stock Exchanges shall intimate the\nentities (and their TM/CM) if the FutEq OI in options on any index is\nbeyond the permissible limit (i.e. ₹1,500 cr. net or ₹10,000 cr. gross\nlong / gross short).\n2.3.2.2.5.2. If the entity has long position beyond permissible limits then cash (or\ncash equivalent) would be required to be intimated to Stock Exchanges\n/ CCs by 12 noon next trading day (T+1). If the entity has short position\nbeyond permissible limits after considering the security holding value\nof T day or long position beyond permissible limits after considering the\ncash / cash equivalent reported by 12 noon on T+1 day, the entity will\nhave to bring down options positions within permissible limit by end of\nT+1, as per delta value of derivatives contracts as of end of T+1.\n2.3.2.2.5.3. If entities don’t have systems to compute same day delta, bringing end\nof day position on T+1 day within the permissible limit with T day market\nclose data provided by Stock Exchange for various derivatives\ncontracts, shall also be considered acceptable.\n2.3.2.2.5.4. If the entity fails to reduce the position within the permissible limit on\nT+1 day, as mentioned at para 2.3.2.2.5.3 above, would result in to levy\nof Additional Surveillance Deposit by Stock exchanges in accordance\nwith para 2.3.2.2.4 above.\n2.3.2.2.5.5.

Excess position beyond permissible limits, will attract Additional\nSurveillance Deposit/Penalty, as decided by Stock Exchanges.\nPage 19 of 21\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n2.3.2.2.5.6. It is emphasized that the provision of one day to reduce the position\nbeyond permissible limit is only with the intention to provide time to\nimplement delta monitoring system by clients / trading members who\nwish to take excess positions close to or beyond permissible limit. It\nwould not impact typical retail traders / investors. To that extent, Stock\nExchanges shall discuss the instances of entities repeatedly taking\nexcess position for a day in fortnightly surveillance meeting with SEBI\nto ensure that the instant glide path is not misused by any entity to take\nlarge overnight positions beyond permissible limit.\n2.3.2.2.5.7.

Till the SOP at 2.3.2.2.3. is formulated, the extant penalty structure for\nbreach of overall TM level limits would continue.\n2.3.2.3.4. It is also noted that that Open Interest of both the participants and the\nmarket is dynamic and changing throughout the day. With a view of\nproviding better clarity to the market participants in terms of their position\nlimits, the following has been decided:\nPage 20 of 21\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n2.3.2.3.4.1. The positions of market participants in index option contracts shall\nalso be monitored based on total OI of the market in index option\ncontracts, at the end of previous day’s trade.\n2.3.2.3.4.2. In case of a drop in index options OI compared to the previous\nday’s index options OI, market participants may breach the\nspecified position limits even if their positions have remained\nunchanged/reduced throughout the day.\n2.3.2.3.4.3. Such cases of passive breaches shall not be considered as\nviolation.\n2.3.3. Monitoring of position limits\n2.3.3.1. FPI\nSame as that for index future contracts as specified in clause 1.3.3.1\n2.3.3.2. Mutual Fund\nSame as that for index future contracts as specified in clause 1.3.3.2\n2.3.4.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (“SEBI Act”) mandates SEBI\nto protect the interest of investors in securities and to promote the development of,\nand to regulate the securities market, by such measures as it thinks fit. One of the\nmeasures to achieve the aforesaid objective is through regulating the business in\nthe stock exchanges.\n2. Under the extant Regulatory provisions, stock exchanges can decide upon the\nexpiry day of their derivatives products. In the multi exchange framework, spacing\nout of expiry days through the week reduces concentration risk and provides an\nopportunity to stock exchanges to offer product differentiation to market\nparticipants. At the same time, too many expiry days has the potential to revive\nexpiry day hyperactivity which could jeopardize investor protection and market\nstability. Against the aforesaid backdrop, a consultation paper was issued by SEBI\non March 27, 2025, in the matter. The comments received were examined by SEBI,\nand the matter was further deliberated in Secondary Market Advisory Committee\n(SMAC) of SEBI.\n3. Based on the aforesaid and in exercise of powers conferred under Section 11 (1)\nread with Section 11(2)(a) of the SEBI Act, 1992, to protect the interests of\ninvestors in securities and to promote the development of, and to regulate the\nsecurities market, following has been decided with regard to final settlement day /\nexpiry day for equity derivatives contracts:\nPage 1 of 2\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n3.1. Expiries of all equity derivatives contracts of an exchange will be uniformly\nlimited to either Tuesday or Thursday.\n3.2. Every exchange will continue to be allowed one weekly benchmark index\noptions contract on their chosen day (Tuesday or Thursday).\n3.3. Besides benchmark index options contracts, all other equity derivatives\ncontracts, viz., all benchmark index futures contracts, non-benchmark index\nfutures / options contracts, and all single stock futures / options contracts will\nbe offered with a minimum tenor of 1 month, and the expiry will be in the last\nweek of every month on their chosen day (that is last Tuesday or last Thursday\nof the month).\n3.4. Exchanges will now seek prior approval of SEBI for modifying the settlement\nday of their derivatives contracts from the one which has been existing.\n4. To operationalize the aforesaid circular, stock exchanges shall submit their\nproposal to SEBI, in compliance with Clause 3 above, by June 15, 2025.\n5. Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations are directed to take necessary steps\nto put in place systems for implementation of this Circular, including necessary\namendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulations, if any.\n6.

Process for appointment, re-appointment, termination or acceptance of\nresignation of specific Key Management Personnel (KMPs) of a Market\nInfrastructure Institution (MII); and\nii. Cooling-off period for KMPs of an MII joining a competing MII\niii. Provision relating to re-appointment of Public Interest Directors (PIDs)\nA. Process for appointment, re-appointment, termination or acceptance of\nresignation of specific KMPs of an MII\n1. To strengthen the governance framework of Stock Exchanges, Clearing Corporations\nand Depositories (collectively referred as Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs)), it is\nrequired that the Key Management Personnel (KMPs) of MIIs in the crucial areas of\noperations such as compliance, risk management, technology and information security\nare of appropriate stature and independence. These KMPs namely the Compliance\nOfficer (CO), Chief Risk Officer (CRiO), Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Chief\nInformation Security Officer (CISO) are crucial for any MII to deliver on its core public\nPage 1 of 5\n\n--- Page 2 ---\ninterest mandate of giving primacy to compliance, risk management, technological\nresilience and market integrity, over commercial considerations.\n2. While the Governing Board of the MII sets the overall tone, a culture of prioritizing\nefficient discharge of responsibilities towards public interest falling under Verticals 1\nand 2, over commercial interest under Vertical 3 must be ingrained at the operating\nlevel as well.\n3. Along with having a capable and efficient Managing Director (MD), there is a need\nfor KMPs of appropriate stature and ability in Vertical 1 and 2 to ensure that the MII\ndelivers its primary mandate as a public utility infrastructure institution and a first line\nregulator.\n4. Based on the feedback received from various stakeholders through public\nconsultation, recommendations of Secondary Market Advisory Committee of SEBI\n(SMAC) and approval of the Board, it has been decided that the process for\nappointment, re-appointment, termination or acceptance of resignation of specific\nKMPs of Verticals 1 & 2 of an MII shall be as under:\n4.1. For Appointment: The process for appointment shall be as under:\n4.1.1. The MII shall engage an independent external agency to identify and recommend\nsuitable candidates for appointment as CO, CRiO, CTO and CISO or by whatever\ndesignations called. The Agency shall submit its recommendations to the\nNomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) of the MII.\n4.1.2. The NRC will evaluate the recommendations of the agency and after discussion\nwith the management of the MII, submit its recommendations for appointment of\nsuch KMPs to the Governing Board of the MII.\n4.1.3. The Governing Board shall take the final decision for appointment of such KMPs.\nPage 2 of 5\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n4.2. For Re-appointment, Termination or acceptance of Resignation: The process\nfor re-appointment, termination or acceptance of resignation shall be as under:\n4.2.1. The NRC shall evaluate the cases of re-appointment, termination or acceptance of\nresignation of CO, CRiO, CTO and CISO or by whatever designations called and\nafter discussion with the management of the MII, submit its recommendations to\nthe Governing Board of the MII.\n4.2.2. The Governing Board shall take the final decision for re-appointment, termination\nor acceptance of resignation of such KMPs. Provided that no such KMPs shall be\nterminated unless he/she has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard\nby the Governing Board.\n4.3. The above provisions will be applicable to all appointments, re-appointments,\nterminations or acceptance of resignations on or after the date of implementation of\nthis circular.\n4.4. The appointment, re-appointment, termination or acceptance of resignation of KMPs\nother than the MD, CO, CRiO, CTO and CISO shall continue to be with the NRC of\nthe MII. However, the MIIs are free to implement the above mechanism for all KMPs.\nB. Cooling-off period for KMPs of an MII joining a competing MII\n5. Based on the feedback received from various stakeholders, recommendations of\nSMAC and approval of the Board, the following have been decided:\n5.1. The existing requirement for cooling-off period of one year under Securities\nContracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations,\n2018 (SECC Regulations, 2018) and Securities and Exchange Board of India\n(Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 2018 (D&P Regulations, 2018) for PIDs\nPage 3 of 5\n\n--- Page 4 ---\njoining another MII after expiry of terms in one MII have been modified vide Gazette\nNotifications No. SEBI/LAD-NRO/GN/2025/246 and No. SEBI/LAD-\nNRO/GN/2025/245, dated April 30, 2025 to state that the cooling-off period for Non-\nIndependent Directors and PIDs shall be as prescribed by the Governing Board of\nthe MII. The amended provisions will come into force on 90th day from the date of\ntheir publication in the Official Gazette.\n5.2. The Governing Board of an MII shall prescribe the mechanism for a cooling-off\nperiod for KMPs (including the MD) of the MII joining a competing MII as a KMP.\n5.3. For the purpose of this provision, the expression “competing MII” i.e. “competing\nrecognised stock exchange or recognised clearing corporation” and “competing\ndepository” shall be as explained under SECC Regulations, 2018 and D&P\nRegulations, 2018 respectively.\nC. Re-appointment of PID\n6. Based on approval of the Board, it has been decided that in case the existing PID\nafter completion of his first term is not considered for re-appointment by the\nGoverning Board of the MII, the rationale for the same shall be recorded and\ninformed to SEBI.\n7. Applicability: The provisions of the circular shall be applicable from the 90th day of\nissuance of the circular.\n8. All MIIs are advised to:\ni. take necessary steps and put in place necessary systems for implementation of\nthe above.\nii. make necessary amendments to the relevant byelaws, rules and regulations,\nwherever required, for the implementation of the above; and.\nPage 4 of 5\n\n--- Page 5 ---\niii. bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of the market participants\n(including investors) and disseminate the same on their website.\n9.

Stock Exchanges, Clearing Corporations and Depositories (hereinafter referred as\nMarket Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs)) are institutions that provide vital capital market\ninfrastructure for trading; clearing & settlement; and holding, transfer & record keeping of\nsecurities. MIIs have a unique operating model in that they are empowered by law to\nregulate their members such as Trading Members, Clearing Members, Depository\nParticipants, etc. The primary objective of an MII is to focus more towards serving as a\ncrucial public utility infrastructure institution and a first line regulator for its constituents,\nwhile operating as efficient, innovative and competitive commercial entity.\nA. Norms for the Internal Audit Mechanism at MIIs\n2. It is essential that the MIIs shall operate in an efficient and transparent manner, be\naccountable for their actions, maintain highest standards of governance and risk\nmanagement, etc. Internal audit helps to identify, assess, and mitigate risks that could\nPage 1 of 5\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nimpact the MII’s operations, efficiency, financial stability, etc. Internal audit also ensures\nthat the MII’s comply with relevant laws, regulations, circulars, guidelines, industry\nstandards, etc.\n3. MIIs being corporate entities governed by the provisions of Companies Act, 2013 are\nrequired to conduct Internal Audit. Further, in terms of Securities Contracts (Regulation)\n(Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2018 (SECC Regulations,\n2018) and Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants)\nRegulations, 2018 (D&P Regulations, 2018), the governing boards of the MIIs are\nrequired to provide for three lines of defense of which the third line of defense comprises\nthe Internal Audit Function.\n4. In order to further strengthen the governance mechanism at MIIs, based on the feedback\nreceived from various stakeholders and recommendations of Secondary Market\nAdvisory Committee of SEBI (SMAC), the following guidelines for the internal audit\nmechanism at MIIs have been prescribed:\n4.1. Every MII shall conduct internal audit of all functions and activities of the MII (i.e.\nfunctions and activities of Vertical 1 (Critical operations), Vertical 2 (Regulatory,\ncompliance, risk management and investor grievances) and Vertical 3 (Other\nfunctions including business development)) at least once in a Financial Year.\n4.2. The internal auditor of the MII shall be an independent audit firm(s). The MIIs shall\nhave a policy for appointment of internal auditors approved by the Audit Committee\nand governing board of the MII.\n4.3. Internal auditor of an MII shall report only to the Audit Committee of the MII.\n4.4. The scope of the internal auditor shall include all functions and activities of the MIIs\n(i.e. functions and activities of Vertical 1, Vertical 2 and Vertical 3) and shall be\napproved by the Audit Committee of the MII (including any other area as may be\nspecified by the Audit Committee). Further, in order to standardize the terms of\nPage 2 of 5\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nreference of the internal auditor across similar MIIs, the MIIs may do so in\nconsultation with the Industry Standards Forum of MIIs (ISF).\n4.5. The observations of the internal auditor shall be sent to the respective Head of\nDepartments (HoDs) for their comments in a time bound manner.\n4.6. The internal auditor after incorporating comments of the HoDs shall share the final\nreport with the Audit Committee in a time bound manner. Further, any initial\nobservation(s) of the internal auditor, which have been dropped/closed subsequent to\nthe clarifications/comments of HoDs, shall also be included in the Final Report, along\nwith rationale/justifications for dropping such observation(s). Wherever required, the\nAudit Committee may seek views of other Statutory Committees of the MII on the\nobservations of the internal auditor.\n4.7. The various timelines for internal audit shall be prescribed by the Audit Committee of\nthe MII.\n4.8. The internal auditor of the MII shall appraise the Audit Committee, at least once in\nevery six months within 60 days from the end of September and March, on critical\nissues concerning the MII, in the absence of the management.\nB. Composition of the Audit Committee of the MII\n5. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee (AC) amongst others involves approval of\nrelated party transactions, scrutiny of financial statements, evaluation of internal financial\ncontrols and risk management systems, etc. which requires objective evaluation of the\nfunctioning and decisions of the management.\n6. In order to further strengthen the governance of the MII, based on the feedback received\nfrom various stakeholders and recommendations of the SMAC, the following have been\ndecided:\n6.1. The Audit Committee of the MII shall not consist of any Executive Director (including\nthe Managing Director) of the MII;\nPage 3 of 5\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n6.2.

Para 5.6.1 of the Master Circular for Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) (\"Master\nCircular\") dated May 16, 2024 provides that in addition to the standardized rating\nscales prescribed for various instruments, an Expected Loss (EL) based Rating\nScale may be used by CRAs for ratings of projects/ instruments associated with\ninfrastructure sector.\n2. Pursuant to deliberations with various stakeholders, including the Corporate\nBonds and Securitisation Advisory Committee (CoBoSAC), it is felt that EL\nRatings, when used along with standardized rating scale/ Probability of Default\n(PD) Rating, can better reflect the recovery prospects of municipal bonds. Further,\nUrban Local Bodies/ Municipalities issue bonds primarily for the creation/\ndevelopment of infrastructure. Therefore, it has been decided that CRAs may, in\naddition to the standardised rating scale, extend the EL-based Rating Scale for\nrating of Municipal Bonds which are issued for financing infrastructure assets.\n3.

In order to facilitate SEBI registered stock brokers to undertake securities market\nrelated activities in Gujarat International Finance Tech-city – International Financial\nServices Centre (GIFT-IFSC), it has been decided to do away with the requirement\nof obtaining specific approval from SEBI.\n2. Stock brokers proposing to undertake securities market related activities in GIFT-\nIFSC are permitted to do so under a Separate Business Unit (SBU) of the stock\nbroking entity itself. These activities can also be carried out if the branch qualifies\nas an SBU.\n3. Existing practice of carrying out securities market related activities in GIFT-IFSC\nthrough a subsidiary is also allowed.

The Master Circular for Stock Brokers dated August 09, 2024 (“Master Circular”),\nrequires the Trading Members (TMs)/ Clearing Members (CMs) to collect margins\nfrom their clients in cash segment (Para 39.1)\n2. TMs / CMs are required to mandatorily collect upfront VaR margins and ELM from\ntheir clients. TMs/CMs have time till ‘T+2’ working days to collect margins (except VaR\nmargins and ELM) from their clients (Para 39.1.2).\n3. With effect from January 27, 2023, settlement cycle has been reduced from T+2 to\nT+1 across all scrips in cash market. In this regard, based on representation received\nfrom the Brokers’ Industry Standards Forum (ISF) and to ensure a more robust risk\nmanagement framework, it has been decided that keeping in view the change in the\nsettlement cycles, the TMs/ CMs shall be required to collect margins (except VaR\nmargins and ELM) from their clients by the settlement day.\n4. Accordingly, the below given paras of the Master Circular shall be modified as follows:\nPara 39.1.2: “Henceforth, like in derivatives segment, the TMs/CMs in cash\nsegment are also required to mandatorily collect upfront VaR margins and ELM\nfrom their clients. The TMs/CMs will have time till settlement day to collect margins\n(except VaR margins and ELM) from their clients. (The clients must ensure that\nthe VaR margins and ELM are paid in advance of trade and other margins are paid\nas soon as margin calls are made by the Stock Exchanges/TMs/CMs. The period\ntill settlement has been allowed to TMs/CMs to collect margin from clients taking\nPage 1 of 2\n\n--- Page 2 ---\ninto account the practical difficulties often faced by them only for the purpose of\nlevy of penalty and it should not be construed that clients have been allowed time\ntill settlement day to pay margin due from them).”\nPara 39.1.3: “If pay-in (both funds and securities) is made by settlement day, the\nother margins would deemed to have been collected and penalty for short / non\ncollection of other margins shall not arise.”\nPara 39.1.5: “If client fails to make pay-in by settlement day and TM / CM do not\ncollect other margins from the client by settlement day, the same shall also result\nin levy of penalty as applicable.”\n5. The circular shall come into force from the date of its issuance.\n6. The Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations are advised to:\n6.1. Make necessary amendments to the relevant bye-laws, rules and regulations for\nthe implementation of the above decision, as may be necessary/applicable.\n6.2. Bring the provisions of this circular to the notice of the market Participants and to\ndisseminate the same on their website.\n7.
